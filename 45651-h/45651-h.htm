<p>Morning was breaking over the landscape;
a cool, refreshing breeze, laden with woodland
sweets and wild birds' songs, softly kissed Mildred's
cheek and awoke her.</p>

<p>She started up with a low exclamation of
delight, sprang to the open window, and kneeling
there with her elbow on the sill and her
cheek in her hand, feasted her eyes upon the
beauty of the scene&mdash;a grand panorama of
wooded hills, falling waters, wild glens and
forests and craggy mountains, above whose
lofty summits the east was glowing with crimson
and gold.</p>

<p>Another moment and the sun burst through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the golden gate and began anew his daily round,
"rejoicing as a strong man to run a race."</p>

<p>The brightness of his face was too dazzling
for Mildred's eyes, and her gaze fell lower
down, where wreaths of gray mist hung over
the valleys or crept slowly up the mountain
sides. Presently it rested on one of the nearer
hill-tops, and a sudden, vivid blush suffused
her cheek, while a sweet and tender smile
shone in her eyes and hovered about her lips.</p>

<p>But a sigh quickly followed, smile and blush
faded away, and she dropped her face into her
hands with a low-breathed exclamation, "Oh
what shall I do? What ought I to do?"</p>

<p>There was a question of grave importance
awaiting her decision&mdash;a decision which would
in all probability affect the happiness of her
whole future life on earth; yea, who should say
its influence would not reach even into eternity?</p>

<p>She longed to take counsel of her mother,
but that mother was far distant, and the question
one the girl shrank from putting upon
paper and trusting to the mails.</p>

<p>But a dearer, wiser, even more loving friend
was close at hand, and to Him and His Word
she turned for guidance.</p>

<p>Subdued sounds of life came to Mildred's
ear ere she closed the Book; servants were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
astir setting the house to rights and preparing
breakfast for the numerous guests, most of
whom still lingered in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>Mildred made a rapid but neat toilet, then
stole softly from the room, promising herself
a stroll through the grounds while yet the
quiet and dewy freshness of early morning
lingered there.</p>

<p>In one of the wide cool porches of the hotel
a young man paced to and fro with hasty, agitated
step, glancing up again and again with
longing impatience at the windows of a certain
room on the second floor. Pausing in his walk,
he drew out his watch.</p>

<p>"Only a brief half-hour!" he sighed. "Am
I not to see her at all?"</p>

<p>But at that instant there stepped from the
open doorway a slight, graceful, girlish figure
in a dainty white muslin, a bunch of wildflowers
in her belt, a broad-brimmed straw hat
in her hand; and with a low exclamation, "Ah,
at last!" he hurried to meet her.</p>

<p>She started slightly at sight of him and sent
a hurried glance this way and that, as if meditating
flight.</p>

<p>"O Mildred, don't run away! why should
you avoid me?" he said entreatingly, holding
out his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a scarcely perceptible hesitation
in her manner as she gave him hers.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," she said softly. "Is anything
wrong? I think you look troubled."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am called away suddenly; must
leave within the hour; a dear, only sister lies
at the point of death."</p>

<p>His tones grew husky and her eyes filled
with tears.</p>

<p>"Oh what sad news! I am so sorry for
you!" she murmured.</p>

<p>He drew her hand within his arm and led
her down a shaded alley.</p>

<p>"It is in your power to give me unspeakable
comfort," he said, bending over her. "You
wear my flowers; O dearest! is not that a
whisper of hope to me? You have decided in
my favor? is it not so?"</p>

<p>"O Charlie, don't ask me! I&mdash;I have not
been able yet to see that&mdash;that I may&mdash;that I
ought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To follow the dictates of your heart? Is
that what you would say?" he asked, as she
broke off abruptly, leaving the sentence unfinished.
"O Mildred! you cannot have the heart
to refuse me this one crumb of comfort? We
must part in a few moments&mdash;when to meet
again neither of us knows. You have refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
to pledge yourself to me, and I will not ask it
now&mdash;though I solemnly promise you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, don't," she interrupted, struggling
with her tears; "I would have you free&mdash;free
as air; since I&mdash;I can promise nothing."</p>

<p>"I will never marry any one but you," he
said with vehemence. "If I cannot win you,
I will live single all my days. But you do
care for me? You do love me? O Mildred!
one word, only a word or a look, that I may
not go away on my sorrowful errand in utter
despair. Only assure me that I have won your
heart, and I shall never abandon hope that this
barrier may some day be removed."</p>

<p>She could not refuse him: she had not power
to hide either her love or her grief that they
must part; both had their way for a short
space.</p>

<p>He had led her into an arbor whose sheltering
vines would screen them from prying eyes;
and there clasped in each other's arms, heart
beating against heart, his bearded lip softly
touching again and again her cheek, her brow,
her quivering lips, they passed the few precious
moments that yet remained to them.</p>

<p>He was gone; and as the last echo of his departing
footsteps died away upon her ear there
came over Mildred such a sense of utter desolation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
as she had never known before. Sinking
down upon a rustic bench she hid her face
in her hands, and for a few moments allowed
her full heart to ease itself in a burst of weeping.</p>

<p>But this would not do; the breakfast hour
drew near, and though it had been of late her
aunt's custom to take that meal in bed, her
uncle would expect to see her in her usual
place at the table, and his keen eye would be
quick to detect the traces of tears. The
cousins, too, would notice them and not scruple
to inquire the cause.</p>

<p>She hastily dried her eyes, rose, and leaving
the arbor, strolled about the grounds, resolutely
striving to recover her wonted cheerfulness.</p>

<p>She had made the circuit once, and again
neared the arbor, when she heard her name
called in sweet, childish treble, "Cousin Milly,
Cousin Milly!" and as she turned in the direction
of the sound, little Elsie, closely followed
by her faithful mammy, came bounding toward
her with a letter in her hand.</p>

<p>"Grandpa said I might bring it to you.
Ain't you so glad, cousin?" she asked; and the
missive was put into Mildred's hand, the sweet
baby face held up for a kiss.</p>

<p>Mildred bestowed it very heartily, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the little one in her arms and repeating the
caress again and again, "Very glad, darling,"
she said, "and very much obliged to my pet
for bringing it. Is it time to go in to breakfast,
Aunt Chloe?"</p>

<p>"Massa Dinsmore say you will hab time to
read de lettah first, Miss Milly," replied the
nurse, dropping a courtesy.</p>

<p>"Then I will do so," Mildred said, re-entering
the arbor.</p>

<p>"May mammy and Elsie stay wis you?"
asked the baby girl coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Yes indeed, darling," Mildred said, making
room for the child to sit by her side.</p>

<p>"Dere now, honey, keep quiet and don't
'sturb yo' cousin while she reads de lettah,"
cautioned Aunt Chloe, lifting her nursling
and settling her comfortably on the bench.</p>

<p>Mildred had broken the seal, and was already
too much absorbed in the news from home to
hear or heed what her companions might be
saying.</p>

<p>Elsie watched her, as she read, with loving,
wistful eyes. "Did your mamma write it,
cousin?" she asked, as Mildred paused to turn
the page.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; and she sends love and kisses
to you, and wishes I could take you home with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
me when I go. Oh, if I only could!" And
Mildred bent down to press another kiss on the
sweet baby lips.</p>

<p>"Maybe my papa will let me go, if grandpa
will write and ask him," returned the child,
with an eager, joyous look up into Mildred's
face. "But I couldn't go wisout mammy."</p>

<p>"Oh no! if you should go, mammy would
go too; you can't be separated from her, and
we would all be glad to have her there," Mildred
said, softly caressing the shining curls of
the little one, glancing kindly up into the dusky
face of the nurse, then turning to her letter
again.</p>

<p>It was with mingled feelings that she perused
it, for though all was well with the dear
ones beneath her father's roof, and the thought
of soon again looking upon their loved faces
made most welcome the summons home which
it brought, there was sorrow and pain in the
prospect of soon bidding a long farewell to
the darling now seated by her side&mdash;the little
motherless one over whom her heart yearned
so tenderly because of the lack of parental
love and care that made the young life seem so
sad and forlorn, spite of all the beauty and
wealth with which she&mdash;the little fair one&mdash;was
so abundantly dowered.</p>

<p>As she read the last line, then slowly refolded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the letter, tears gathered in her eyes. Elsie
saw them, and stealing an arm round her neck,
said in her sweet baby tones, "Don't cry,
Cousin Milly. What makes you sorry? I
loves you ever so much."</p>

<p>"And I you, you precious, lovely darling!"
cried Mildred, clasping the little form close and
kissing the pure brow again and again. "That
is just what almost breaks my heart at the
thought of&mdash;oh why, why don't you belong to
us!" she broke off with a half-stifled sob.</p>

<p>A firm, quick step came up the gravel walk,
and Mr. Dinsmore stood looking down upon
them.</p>

<p>"Why, what is wrong? not bad news from
home, I hope, Milly?"</p>

<p>"No, uncle; they are all well, and everything
going smoothly so far as I can learn
from my letter," she said, brushing away her
tears and forcing a smile.</p>

<p>"What then?" he asked, "Elsie has not
been troubling you, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, she never does that!"</p>

<p>"Breakfast has been announced; shall we go
and partake of it?"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir. I am quite ready," Mildred
answered, as she rose and took his offered
arm.</p>

<p>"Bring the child," he said to Chloe; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
walking on. "What is wrong, Milly? there
must have been a cause for the tears you have
certainly been shedding."</p>

<p>"I am summoned home, uncle, and glad as
I shall be to see it and all the dear ones there,
again, I can't help feeling sorry to leave you
all."</p>

<p>"I hope not. Dear me, I wish we could
keep you always!" he exclaimed. "But when
and how are you to go?"</p>

<p>"Mother wrote that a gentleman friend&mdash;our
minister, Mr. Lord&mdash;will be in Philadelphia
in the course of three or four weeks,
spend a few days there, then go back to Pleasant
Plains, and that he has kindly offered to
take charge of me. Mother and father think
I should embrace the opportunity by all means,
as it may be a long time before another as good
will offer."</p>

<p>"And doubtless they are right, though I
wish it had not come so soon."</p>

<p>"So soon, uncle?" Mildred returned brightly.
"Do you forget that I have been with you
for nearly a year?"</p>

<p>"A year is a very short time at my age," he
answered with a smile.</p>

<p>But they were at the door of the breakfast-room,
and the topic was dropped for the present,
as by mutual consent.</p>

<p>The end of the week found the Dinsmores
and Mildred in Philadelphia, very busy with
sight-seeing and shopping. Each one of the
party was to be furnished with a suitable outfit
for fall and the coming winter, and Mildred
had a long list of commissions from her
mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dinsmore showed herself keenly interested
in the purchase of her own and her
children's finery, languidly so in Mildred's;
these procured, she immediately declared herself
completely worn out and unfit for further
exertion.</p>

<p>No one regretted it; Mildred had learned
to rely to a great extent upon her own taste
and judgment, and with Mr. Dinsmore's
efficient help succeeded quite to her satisfaction
in filling out the remainder of her list.</p>

<p>To him fell the task of buying for his little
granddaughter, and Mildred was not a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
gratified by being taken into his counsels and
invited to assist his choice of materials and
the fashion in which they should be made up.</p>

<p>Spite of some drawbacks to her pleasure,
principally caused by Mrs. Dinsmore's infirmities
of temper, Mildred thoroughly enjoyed
her stay in the City of Brotherly Love.</p>

<p>It was drawing to a close, when, on coming
down from her room one morning and entering
the private parlor of their party, she was
met by a joyous greeting from little Elsie.</p>

<p>"O Cousin Milly, I'm so glad! Grandpa
has got a letter from my papa, and my papa
says Elsie must go and buy some pretty
presents for all the folks at your home. Isn't
that ever so nice?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, darling, you and your papa,"
Mildred said, stooping to caress the child.
"He is very kind, and I know your generous
little heart can find no greater pleasure than
in giving to others."</p>

<p>"She's a Dinsmore in that," her grandfather
said with a proud smile; "they have
always esteemed it the greatest luxury wealth
can purchase. And Elsie is fortunately abundantly
able to gratify herself in that way, and
her father has given her carte blanche (subject
to my approval, of course); so, my dear, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
are not to object to anything we may take it
into our heads to do."</p>

<p>He patted Elsie's curly pate as he spoke,
and looked smilingly into Mildred's eyes.</p>

<p>"You are very kind now and always,
uncle," the young girl responded, returning
his smile and blushing slightly; "and I don't
know that I have a right to object to anything
that is not done for myself."</p>

<p>The entrance of Mrs. Dinsmore and her
children simultaneously with the bringing in
of breakfast, put a stop to the conversation.</p>

<p>"Well, Mildred, if it suits your convenience,
we will set out at once upon this final
shopping expedition," her uncle said as they
left the table; and her consent being given,
he directed Chloe to make Elsie ready to accompany
them.</p>

<p>The child was in her element as they went
from one store to another, and she chose, with
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'asisstance'">assistance</ins> of her grandfather and cousin,
her gifts to Mildred's parents, brothers, and
sisters.</p>

<p>At length they entered the largest jewelry
establishment in the city, and Mr. Dinsmore
asked to be shown some of their best gold
watches for ladies.</p>

<p>"I am commissioned to select one for a lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
friend," he said to Mildred in a grave, half-preoccupied
tone as the jeweller promptly
complied with his request, "and I want your
assistance in making a choice."</p>

<p>"But I am no judge of a watch, uncle," she
returned; "Elsie here could select about as
well as I."</p>

<p>"Elsie shall have her say about it, too," Mr.
Dinsmore said, looking smilingly from one to
the other. "All I want from either of you is
an opinion in regard to the outside appearance,
while this gentleman and I will judge of the
quality of the works."</p>

<p>They presently made a selection of both
watch and chain satisfactory to all parties.
Elsie chose a plain gold ring for Mildred, and
one for each of her sisters, and they left the
store.</p>

<p>Elsie whispered something to her grandfather
as he took his seat beside her in the
carriage.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Wait till we get
home," he said rather curtly; "we are going
now to choose the new piano."</p>

<p>It was for the drawing-room at Roselands,
and he took Mildred with him to try the instruments
and tell him which she thought the
best and finest toned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Mildred was equally charmed with several&mdash;two
in particular&mdash;and they had some little
difficulty in fixing upon the one that should
be ordered to Roselands.</p>

<p>"I will leave it undecided for to-day," Mr.
Dinsmore said at length, "and will call again
to-morrow."</p>

<p>On the way to their hotel, and when arrived
there, little Elsie seemed all eagerness, yet
kept it in check in obedience to an occasional
warning look from her grandfather.</p>

<p>Mildred went directly to her room to remove
her bonnet and shawl, then sat down in
a low chair by the window to rest and think
while awaiting the summons to dinner.</p>

<p>She had scarcely done so when there was a
gentle tap, as of baby fingers, at her door, and
Elsie's sweet voice was heard asking in eager,
excited tones for admittance.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling, come in," Mildred answered;
and the door flew open and the child ran in,
closely followed by her mammy.</p>

<p>The small hands held a jewel-case, and the
large, soft brown eyes were full of love and
delight as she hastened to place it in Mildred's
lap, saying, "It's for you, cousin; my papa
said in his letter that Elsie might buy it for
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>She raised the lid. "See, Cousin Milly,
see! Aren't you so glad?"</p>

<p>There lay the watch and chain they had
helped Mr. Dinsmore select that morning.</p>

<p>A watch was a far greater luxury in those
days than it is now, and this a costly and
beautiful one. Mildred could scarcely believe
the evidence of her senses; surely it must be
all a dream. She gazed at the child in dumb
surprise.</p>

<p>Elsie lifted her pretty present with dainty
care, threw the chain round Mildred's neck,
and slid the watch into the bosom of her dress;
then stepping back a little to take a better
view, "See, mammy, see!" she cried, clapping
her hands and dancing up and down in delight,
"doesn't it look pretty on cousin?"</p>

<p>"Jus' lubly, honey. Don't Miss Milly like
it?"</p>

<p>Aunt Chloe's look into Mildred's face was
half reproachful, half entreating. Could it be
possible that her darling's beautiful, costly gift
was not appreciated?</p>

<p>"Like it?" cried Mildred, catching the child
in her arms and covering the little face with
kisses, a tear or two mingling with them to
the great wonderment of the little one; "like
it? Oh it is only too lovely and expensive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
be bestowed upon me! Sweet pet, you should
keep it for yourself. Cousin Milly ought not
to take it from you."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa did say so in his letter. Grandpa
read the words to Elsie. And when I's
big enough I is to have my mamma's watch."</p>

<p>"But it cost so much," murmured Mildred
half to herself, as she drew out the watch and
gazed at it with admiring eyes.</p>

<p>"My chile hab plenty ob money," responded
Aunt Chloe, "and houses and land and
eberyting ob dis world's riches; and she lubs
you, Miss Milly, and ef you don' take dat
watch and chain she will most break her
bressed little heart. Won't you, honey?"</p>

<p>The child nodded, and the soft eyes gazing
into Mildred's filled with tears. It was impossible
to resist their eloquent pleading.</p>

<p>"Then cousin will accept it with her heartiest
thanks, and value it more for the sake of
the dear little giver than for its usefulness, its
beauty, or its cost," Mildred said, taking Elsie
on her lap and holding her in a close, loving
embrace. "Dear little girlie," she murmured
tenderly, "cousin will never intentionally rob
you of the smallest pleasure or plant the least
thorn in your path."</p>

<p>Another light tap at the door, and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Dinsmore joined them. "Ah! that is right,"
he said with a smiling glance at the chain about
Mildred's neck.</p>

<p>"Uncle, it is too much. You should not
have allowed it. How could you?" Mildred
asked half reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I only obeyed orders," was his laughing
rejoinder. "Horace feels, as I do also, that
we owe a debt of gratitude to your mother&mdash;to
say nothing of the affection we have for
you all; and he knows from the reports I have
given him of his child that he could not afford
her a greater gratification than the permission
to do this. Beside, you have been extremely
kind to her, and ought not to object
to her making you some small return in the
only way she can."</p>

<p>"O uncle! her love and sweet caresses have
more than recompensed the little I have been
able to do for her, the darling!" cried Mildred,
heaping fresh caresses upon the little fair one.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord called that afternoon to report
himself as arrived in the city, and to inquire
if it were Mildred's intention to accept his
escort on the homeward journey. His stay
would necessarily be short&mdash;not more than
two or three days.</p>

<p>Mildred met him with outstretched hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and eyes shining with pleasure. She had been
so long away from home, was so hungry for
a sight of anything connected with Pleasant
Plains, that had she unexpectedly encountered
Damaris Drybread she would very probably
have greeted her with something like affection.</p>

<p>She perceived no change in Mr. Lord, except
that he had a new set of teeth; he seemed
to her in all other respects precisely what he
was when she bade him good-by a year ago;
but he was astonished, bewildered, delighted
at the change in her. He had always admired
her fresh young beauty, but it was as though
the sweet bud had blossomed into the half-blown,
lovely rose, with just a few of its petals
still softly folded.</p>

<p>He blushed and stammered, answered her
eager queries about old friends, and all that
had been going on in Pleasant Plains since
she left, in the most absent-minded way, and
scarcely took his eyes from her face. In short,
so conducted himself as to make his feelings
toward her evident to the most careless observer.</p>

<p>"Mildred," said Mrs. Dinsmore, when at
last he had taken his departure for that day,
"if I were your mother you should stay from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
home another year before I would trust you
to travel with that man!"</p>

<p>"Why, aunt, you cannot think him anything
but a good man!" exclaimed the girl in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Humph! that's a question I don't pretend
to decide. But don't, I beg of you, let him
persuade you on the way that it is your duty
to marry him. If he can only make you believe
it's your duty, you'll do it whether you
want to or not."</p>

<p>Mildred's cheek flushed hotly. "O Aunt
Dinsmore!" she cried, "he could never be so
foolish! why, he is old enough to be my father,
and so wise and good; and I but a silly young
thing, as unfit as possible for the duties and
responsibilities of a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Minister's wife," suggested Mrs. Dinsmore,
as the young girl broke off in confusion.
"Well, I don't know about that; you are
pious enough in all conscience. But, Mildred,
you positively must reject him; it would be a
terribly hard life, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aunt, he has not offered, and I believe, I
hope, never will. So I am not called upon to
consider the question of acceptance or rejection."</p>

<p>"That was very rude, Miss Keith&mdash;your interrupting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
me in that way," Mrs. Dinsmore
said, half in displeasure, half in sport. "Well,
if you will allow me, I shall finish what I had
to say. I've set my heart on seeing you and
Charlie Landreth make a match. There! why
do you color so, and turn your head away?
Charlie likes you&mdash;is in fact deeply in love, I
feel perfectly certain, and doubtless will follow
you before long. You may take my word for
it that he would have proposed before we left
the springs if it hadn't been for that sudden
summons to his dying sister."</p>

<p>Mildred made no reply; she had kept her
face studiously averted, and was glad that the
entrance, at that moment, of a servant with a
letter for Mrs. Dinsmore gave her an opportunity
to escape from the room.</p>

</div></div>


<p>The sun was just peeping over the tops of
the tall city houses as Mildred entered the
carriage which was to convey her to the depot.
Mr. Dinsmore and little Elsie&mdash;the two whom
it was a grief of heart to her to leave&mdash;were
with her; Mrs. Dinsmore and the others had
bidden good-by before retiring the previous
night, and were still in bed.</p>

<p>"Elsie, darling, won't you sit in cousin's
lap?" Mildred said, holding out her arms to
receive the child as her grandfather handed
her in at the carriage door.</p>

<p>"No, no! she is much too heavy, and there
is abundance of room," he said hastily.</p>

<p>"But I want to hold her, uncle," returned
Mildred, drawing the little one to her knee.
"I love dearly to have her in my arms, and
this is my last chance."</p>

<p>"As you will, then; a wilful woman will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
have her way," he said lightly, as he settled
himself on the opposite seat and the door
closed upon them with a bang.</p>

<p>The rattling of the wheels over the cobblestones,
as they drove rapidly onward, made
conversation next to impossible; but Mildred
was not sorry: her heart was almost too full
for speech. She clasped little Elsie close, the
child nestling lovingly in her arms, while they
mingled their caresses and tears.</p>

<p>At the depot, too, where there was a half
hour of waiting, they clung together as those
who knew not how to part. Elsie's low sobs
were pitiful to hear, but she stood in too great
awe of her grandfather to indulge in any loud
lament.</p>

<p>He, however, did not reprove her, but
seemed to quite compassionate her grief, and
tried to assuage it with promises of gifts and
indulgences; for Mildred had succeeded to
some extent in softening his heart toward the
motherless little one&mdash;which she now perceived
with joy and thankfulness.</p>

<p>His kindness to herself had been uniform
from the first, and continued to the last moment.
Not till he had seen her on board the
train, and made as comfortable as possible, did
he resign her to the care of Mr. Lord; then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
with a fatherly kiss and an affectionate message
to her mother, he left her.</p>

<p>As the train moved slowly on, she caught a
last glimpse of him, and of Aunt Chloe standing
by his side with the weeping Elsie in her
arms.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord essayed the office of comforter.</p>

<p>"That is a sweet child, Miss Mildred, a very
sweet child. And Mr. Dinsmore seems a
noble man. These partings are sad&mdash;especially
so when we are young; but let the thought of
the dear ones to whom you are going, and of
the better land where partings are unknown,
console and cheer you now."</p>

<p>Mildred could hardly have commanded her
voice to reply, and was glad the increasing
noise of the train relieved her of the necessity
for doing so, but she dried her eyes and resolutely
forced her tears back to their fountain,
calling to mind the lessons on the duty of
cheerfulness taught her by her mother, by both
precept and example.</p>

<p>And oh, it was joy to know that each mile
passed over was bearing her nearer to that
loved monitor! What a cheering thought
was that! and scarcely less so the prospect of
seeing Aunt Wealthy, with whom she and Mr.
Lord were to spend a few days; Lansdale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
being not far out of their route in crossing
Ohio.</p>

<p>At that day there was no continuous line of
railroad from Philadelphia to Pittsburg. They
traveled sometimes by canal, sometimes by
stage, passing over the mountains in the latter.
This proved the most exciting and perilous
part of the journey, the roads being almost
all the way very steep, and often lying along
the edge of a precipice, to plunge over which
would be certain, horrible death.</p>

<p>Much of the scenery was grand and beautiful,
but the enjoyment of it greatly interfered
with by the sense of danger. Many a time
Mildred's heart seemed to leap into her mouth,
and she sent up a silent but strong cry to God
that he would keep the horses from stumbling,
their feet from treading too near the verge.</p>

<p>There was one afternoon so full of terror of
this kind, and importunate prayer for preservation,
that she felt she could never forget it
to the day of her death should she live to the
age of Methuselah.</p>

<p>The stage was full: the back seat was occupied
by our heroine and a young mother with
a babe in her arms and another little one by
her side; the remaining seats were filled with
gentlemen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"That fellow is drunk and in a terribly bad
humor," remarked one of the latter, as the
driver slammed the door to upon them and
mounted to his perch.</p>

<p>"In no fit condition to guide those horses
over the steep and narrow passes that lie between
this and our next halting-place," added
another uneasily. "You had an altercation
with him, hadn't you, Blake?" addressing the
first speaker.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Grey, I had; what business had
he to hurry us off in this style? Why, we
were scarcely seated at the dinner-table when
he blew his horn, and we all had to run to
avoid being left."</p>

<p>"Quite true."</p>

<p>"That's so," assented several voices.</p>

<p>"And the same thing is repeated again and
again, until it has become quite unbearable,"
Blake went on, his eyes sparkling with anger;
"we pay for our food and have no chance to
eat it."</p>

<p>"There seems to be some collusion between
the innkeepers and drivers for the purpose of
defrauding travelers," remarked Mr. Lord.</p>

<p>"Are we not going very fast?" asked the
young mother, turning a pale, anxious face
toward the last speaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dangerously so." And, putting his
head out of the window, he called to the
driver, mildly requesting him to slacken his
speed.</p>

<p>The reply was a volley of oaths and curses,
while the whip was applied to the horses in a
way that made them rear and plunge frightfully.</p>

<p>They had been toiling up a steep ascent,
and now were skirting the mountain side, a
high wall of rock on the one hand, a sheer
descent of many hundred feet on the other.</p>

<p>Blake glanced from the window with a
shudder, and turning a ghastly face upon the
others, "We shall be hurled into eternity in
another minute," he said, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>Then voice after voice was raised, calling to
the driver in expostulation, warning, entreaty.</p>

<p>"You are risking your own life as well as
ours," cried one.</p>

<p>"I tell you I don't care!" he shouted back,
with a fearful oath; "we're behind time, and
I'll lose my place if I don't make it up. I'll
get you to C&mdash;&mdash; by half-past five, or land you
in h&mdash;ll, I don't care which."</p>

<p>"O my children, my poor little children!"
cried the mother, clasping her babe closer to
her breast and bursting into tears. Then, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
a sort of desperation, she thrust her head out
of the window and shrieked to the man, "For
the love of Heaven, driver, have mercy on my
poor babes!"</p>

<p>The man was probably a father, for that
appeal reached his heart, hardened as it was:
there was instantly a very sensible diminution
of their fearful velocity, though the stage still
rolled on at a dangerously rapid rate; keeping
them all in terror until at length it drew up
before the door of a tavern; where they were
to halt for their supper.</p>

<p>The gentlemen made haste to alight. Mr.
Lord handed out Mildred, then the mother
and her children.</p>

<p>"You must be very tired, ladies," he said,
following them into the parlor of the inn,
which was very plainly furnished with rag
carpet, wooden chairs and settee, and green
paper window-blinds, nothing tasteful, nothing
inviting, except an appearance of order
and cleanliness.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am dreadfully tired," the strange
lady answered, dropping into a chair and setting
her babe on her knee, while she drew
the older child to her side and wiped the
tears from its cheeks, for it was sobbing pitifully;
"that was a fearful ride, the jolting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and shaking were bad enough, but the fright
was ten times worse. And we're almost
starved," she added. "My little Mary is crying
with hunger. I hope they'll give us time
to eat here. Do you know, sir, how soon the
stage starts on again?"</p>

<p>"I will step out and inquire; also how soon
the supper will be ready," Mr. Lord said, moving
toward the door.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you, Miss Mildred?"
he asked, pausing upon the threshold.
"You are looking wretchedly pale and fatigued,"
he added, in a tone of concern.</p>

<p>The other gentlemen had gone to the bar-room;
but at this moment Blake came to a
window of the parlor, looking out upon a porch
which ran along the whole front of the house.
He looked red and angry.</p>

<p>"It seems the same game is to be repeated
here," he said, addressing Mr. Lord; "the supper
is not ready and the stage will leave in
half an hour. There is every appearance of
rain too; the night will be cloudy and dark,
making travel over these mountains doubly
dangerous. I propose that we all decide to
remain where we are over night and let the
stage go empty. If the whole party will agree
in doing so, 'twill serve the rascal right, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
perhaps teach him a useful and much needed
lesson. What do you say, sir? you and your&mdash;daughter?"</p>

<p>"My lady friend," stammered Mr. Lord,
coloring violently. "What do you think of
the plan, Miss Mildred?"</p>

<p>Her cheek, too, flushed a rosy red as she
answered eagerly: "Oh, let us stay, by all
means! I'm sure it would be better a great
deal, than risking our lives on such roads at
night."</p>

<p>"Just what I think," said the other lady,
"and my little ones are too tired to travel
any farther to-night. I shall stay whether the
rest do or not. I intend that the children and
I shall have a chance to eat one full meal at
any rate," she added to Mildred, as the gentlemen
walked away together.</p>

<p>The call to supper followed almost immediately
upon the announcement that no one
would leave in the stage that night.</p>

<p>With the keen appetites they brought to it,
our travellers found the fare excellent&mdash;good
bread and butter, baked potatoes, ham and
fresh-laid eggs.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord, seated between the two ladies,
was very kind and attentive to both, but as
usual did some absurdly absent-minded things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you really prefer salt to sugar in your
coffee, Mr. Lord?" asked Mildred demurely,
but with a mischievous twinkle in her eye, as
she saw him draw the salt-cellar toward him
and dip his teaspoon into it.</p>

<p>She had stayed his hand just in time. "Oh
no, certainly not," he said, laughing to cover
his confusion as he hastily emptied the spoon
into his saucer. "It is a very pleasant evening,"
he remarked, sugaring his potato.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Mildred, listening
to the dash of the rain against the window,
for the threatened storm had come. "Then I
suppose, like the Shepherd of Salisbury Plains,
you are pleased with whatever kind of weather
is sent?"</p>

<p>"Certainly we all should be," he said.
"But I was not aware till this moment that
it was raining."</p>

<p>Mildred presently becoming interested in
some talk going on between her opposite
neighbors, had for the moment almost forgotten
Mr. Lord's existence. She was recalled
to it by a hasty movement on his part. He
suddenly pushed back his chair, rose, and
walked out of the room.</p>

<p>A glance at his saucer, half full of coffee,
then at the laughing eyes of the other lady,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
enlightened our heroine as to the cause of
his sudden exit.</p>

<p>"Salted coffee is not, I find, particularly
palatable," he remarked, coming back and resuming
his seat. "I am a sadly absent-minded
person, Miss Mildred; you should watch over
me and prevent such mistakes, as my mother
does at home."</p>

<p>"I really do not feel equal to so arduous an
undertaking," was her sprightly rejoinder.</p>

<p>"This is a lonely spot, not another house
in sight, they say," remarked the mother of
the children to Mildred, as they returned to
the parlor. "I am timid about sleeping alone
in a strange place, and should like to have a
room adjoining yours, if you do not object,
are not afraid of being so near a lioness and
her cubs," she added, with a slight laugh. "I
am Mrs. Lyon."</p>

<p>Mildred gave her name in return, and expressed
entire acquiescence in the proposed
arrangement, and being much fatigued with
their journey they presently retired.</p>

<p>They were up and dressed betimes to make
sure of their breakfast before the early hour
at which the stage was to leave. But they
were treated to a repetition of former experiences.
The meal was delayed, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
had been scarcely ten minutes at the table
when they heard the roll and rumble of the
wheels and the loud "Toot, toot!" of the driver's
horn, as the stage swept round from
the stables and drew up before the tavern door.</p>

<p>There was a hasty swallowing down of another
mouthful or two, a hurried scramble
for hats, bonnets, and parcels, a crowding into
the vehicle, and in a moment more it was toiling
up the mountain side.</p>

<p>The appetite of no one of the party had
been fully satisfied, and there was a good deal
of grumbling and complaining from this one
and that.</p>

<p>"I tell you, friends," said Blake, "it is high
time there was a stop put to this thing. I
have an idea in my head, and at the next
stopping place, if we are hurried off in the
usual style, I want you all to follow my example.
If you will, these rascally fellows will
find themselves outwitted."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What's your plan?" queried one and another,
but the only answer was, "Wait and
you will see, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"There is one thing I have thought of,"
Mrs. Lyon said to Mildred, "I'll have my own
and the children's bonnets on always before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
we are called to the meals. If there should
be some soiling of ribbons, it will be better
than going hungry."</p>

<p>This driver was sober and quiet; the ride, in
consequence, less trying than that of the previous
afternoon. Between twelve and one
they halted for dinner at another country
inn.</p>

<p>There was, as usual, a little waiting time,
then they sat down to an abundant and very
inviting meal, but had not half satisfied their
appetites when roll of wheels and toot of
horn again summoned them to resume their
journey.</p>

<p>Every eye in the party turned upon Blake.
He sprang up instantly, seized a roast chicken
by the leg with one hand, his hat in the other,
and ran for the stage.</p>

<p>"All right!" cried Grey, picking up a pie.
"I'll send the plate home by the driver, landlord,"
he shouted back, as he, too, darted from
the door.</p>

<p>Looking on in dumb astonishment, the landlord
saw bread, rolls, butter, pickles, cheese,
and hard-boiled eggs disappear in like manner,
and before he could utter a remonstrance the
stage was whirling away down the mountain,
not a passenger left behind, nor nearly so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
much food as would have remained had they
been permitted to finish their meal at the
table.</p>

<p>"Outwitted this time, sure as I'm born!"
he muttered at length, turning back into the
deserted dining-room and ruefully eying his
despoiled board.</p>

<p>His wife came hurrying in from the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"So they're off, and we'll have our dinner
now. But," and she stared aghast at an
empty platter. "I say, Jones, where is that
chicken? Didn't I tell you that was for ourselves,
and you wasn't to put a knife into
it?"</p>

<p>"Neither I did," he answered half savagely,
"and it's all the worse for us, seein' they've
carried it off whole, and if I'd a cut it there
might a ben part left on the plate."</p>

<p>"Carried it off!" she cried. "Well, I
never! and it was the nicest, fattest, tenderest
bit of a spring chicken ever you see!"&mdash;and
with a groan she began gathering up the
empty dishes.</p>

<p>"Take that newspaper out of my coat
pocket and spread it over my knees, won't
you, Grey?" said Blake, the moment they
were fairly seated in the stage. "Now your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
jack-knife, please, and I'll carve this fowl. I
fear it'll not be very scientifically dismembered,"
he went on, when his requests had
been complied with, "but sufficiently so to
enable me to make a tolerably equal distribution.
What is your choice, ma'am?" addressing
Mrs. Lyon.</p>

<p>The result of their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coup d'état</i> was a very
comfortable, enjoyable meal seasoned with
many a merry jest over the discomfiture of
the foe, and the makeshifts they themselves
were put to for lack of the usual table appliances.</p>

<p>By the time they reached Lansdale, Mildred
was weary enough to be very glad of a few
days' rest; rest whose delights were doubled
and trebled by being taken in the society of
her dear old aunt.</p>

<p>The travellers were received with the warmest
of welcomes, Mildred embraced over and
over again, and Mr. Lord repeatedly and
heartily thanked for bringing her.</p>

<p>"Dear child, how you are improved!" Aunt
Wealthy said the first moment they found
themselves alone together.</p>

<p>"Have I grown, auntie?" Mildred asked
with an arch smile, laying two shapely, soft
white hands on the old lady's shoulders and
gazing lovingly into her eyes, as they stood
facing each other on the hearth-rug in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the open fire-place in Miss Stanhope's cosey sitting-room;
for it was a cool rainy evening, and
the warmth of a small wood fire blazing and
crackling there was by no means unpleasant.</p>

<p>"Not in height, Milly," Miss Stanhope answered,
giving the young girl a critical survey,
"nor stouter either; but your form has developed,
your carriage is more assured and graceful,
your dress has a certain style it lacked
before, and&mdash;But I must not make you
vain," she added, breaking off with her low
musical laugh. "Come tell me all about your
uncle Dinsmore and his family."</p>

<p>"And little Elsie, the sweet darling!" sighed
Mildred. "Aunt Wealthy, she is a perfect
little fairy: the sweetest, most beautiful creature
you ever laid eyes on."</p>

<p>"Ah! I only wish I could lay eyes on her,"
the old lady rejoined. "Does she resemble
her father in looks?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least: she is said to be the image
of her mother;" and from that Mildred went
on to dwell with minuteness and enthusiasm
on all the charms of the little one, arousing in
her companion a very strong desire to see and
know Elsie for herself.</p>

<p>That subject pretty well exhausted, Mildred
could talk of something else, and found a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
deal to tell about the other Dinsmores, her
own experiences in the South, and the incidents
of her late journey.</p>

<p>They had seated themselves on a sofa. Mr.
Lord, suffering from an attack of sick headache,
had retired to his own apartment directly
after tea, leaving them to the full enjoyment
of each other.</p>

<p>"And have you come back heart whole,
Milly, my dear?" asked the old lady, smiling
into the eyes of her young relative and softly
stroking the hand she held.</p>

<p>The question brought a vivid blush to the
fair young face.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, dear child; I do not wish to
pry into your secrets," Aunt Wealthy hastened
to say.</p>

<p>"No, no, auntie dear, I do not consider it
prying, or wish to keep my affairs from your
knowledge. You and mother are the two I
wish to confide in and consult."</p>

<p>And with many blushes, sighs, and now and
then a few quiet tears, Mildred poured out the
whole story of Charlie Landreth's and her own
love for each other, and the barrier between
them: Aunt Wealthy listening with deep interest
and heartfelt <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'sympthy'">sympathy</ins>.</p>

<p>"Don't despair, dear child," she said, caressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the narrator in tender, motherly fashion,
"and don't give him up. We will join our
prayers in his behalf, and the Lord will, in his
own good time, fulfil to us his gracious promise
to those who agree together to ask a boon
of him."</p>

<p>"Yes, auntie, I do believe he will," Mildred
responded, smiling through her tears, "if we
pray in faith; for in asking for the conversion of
a soul we shall certainly be asking that which
is agreeable to his will. And yet&mdash;O auntie!
it may be long years before our prayers receive
the answer, and I&mdash;I may never see him
again!"</p>

<p>"'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
me all the days of my life,'" repeated Miss
Stanhope in low, soft tones. "Milly dear, try
to leave the future in the hands of Him who
has said, 'I have loved thee with an everlasting
love; I will never leave thee, nor forsake
thee.'"</p>

<p>Both mused in silence for a little; then Miss
Stanhope said, turning with a slight smile toward
her young relative, "Milly, child, you
are very attractive to the other sex."</p>

<p>Mildred colored and looked down. "Aunt
Wealthy," she said, "I hope you do not think
me a coquette?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, child, no! I'm quite sure you are too
kind-hearted to enjoy giving pain to any living
creature."</p>

<p>"That is true, auntie; and for that reason I
wish none would care for me in that way but
the one I can care for in return."</p>

<p>"Yes, and therefore I wish"&mdash;Miss Stanhope
paused, then in answer to Mildred's inquiring
look concluded her sentence&mdash;"that
some other escort had been found for you."</p>

<p>Mildred's cheek crimsoned. "Aunt Wealthy!"
she exclaimed, "do you&mdash;do you really
think he cares for me in that way? Oh I
hope not. Aunt Dinsmore said something of
the sort, but I hoped she was mistaken."</p>

<p>Miss Stanhope's only answer was a meaning
smile and a slight shake of the head.</p>

<p>"Then, Aunt Wealthy, you must help me to
avoid being left alone with him!" cried Mildred
in a tone of apprehension and annoyance;
"and I do hope there will always be other passengers
in the boats and stages, so that he will
have no chance to say a word."</p>

<p>"I'll do what I can, child; cling as close to
me as you will, but you may rest assured he
is bound to speak and have it out with you,
sooner or later."</p>

<p>"He shall not if I can prevent him. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
can he be so extremely silly! But indeed,
Aunt Wealthy, I think you must be mistaken.
He surely has too much sense to fancy me."</p>

<p>"You won't be rude, Milly? you won't forget
the respect due to him as your minister?"</p>

<p>"Not if I can help it. Aunt Wealthy, you
must help me by not leaving us alone together
for a single moment."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, how are my household affairs
to be attended to?"</p>

<p>"When we are all together and you want to
leave the room, just clear your throat and give
me a look, and I'll go first. Then you can
readily excuse yourself on the plea of domestic
matters calling for your attention; and he
may amuse himself with a newspaper or a book
until we rejoin him."</p>

<p>Miss Stanhope laughingly agreed to the
proposed programme, and they carried it out
during the whole visit.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord was very desirous to see Mildred
alone, but found every effort to that end frustrated.
Miss Stanhope seemed always in the
way, and Mildred would accept no invitation
to walk or drive unless her aunt was included
in it. He had formerly considered the aunt
quite a charming old lady, but changed his
opinion somewhat at this particular time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Though undoubtedly a most excellent woman,
and without a superior as a hostess, it was a
decided bore to have to listen to and answer
her talk when he was longing for a private
chat with Mildred.</p>

<p>He bore the trial with what patience he
might, comforting himself with the hope of a
favorable opportunity for his wooing somewhere
on the journey from Lansdale to Pleasant
Plains.</p>

<p>Mildred was dreading the same thing, and
fully resolved to prevent it if possible. Therefore,
when the stage drew up for them at Miss
Stanhope's gate, it was with very different
feelings they perceived that it already contained
several passengers.</p>

<p>"Safe for the present, auntie," whispered
the young girl, as they folded each other in a
last, lingering embrace.</p>

<p>"You can't expect to be so fortunate always,"
returned the old lady in the same low
key, and with a humorous look. "Be sure
to let me have the whole story in your next
letter."</p>

<p>It was staging all the way now. Sometimes
they travelled day and night; sometimes stopped
for a few hours' rest and sleep at a wayside inn.
It was on Monday morning they left Lansdale,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and the journey was not completed until Saturday
noon.</p>

<p>Through all the earlier part of the route
they had plenty of company, the stage being
always pretty well filled, if not crowded.
Most of their fellow-travellers proved intelligent
and agreeable, some, both ladies and gentlemen
remarkably so; and the tedium of the way
was beguiled by talk, now grave, now gay, and
embracing a wide range of topics.</p>

<p>On one occasion a discussion arose on the
propriety and lawfulness of intermarriage between
Christians and worldlings. Some took
the ground that it was a mere matter of choice;
others that it was both dangerous and sinful
for a follower of Christ to marry any other than
a fellow-disciple, or one who was esteemed such.</p>

<p>Of these latter Mr. Lord was one of the
strongest and most decided in the expressions
of his sentiments and convictions, quoting a
number of passages of Scripture to sustain his
views.</p>

<p>During the whole of the conversation Mildred
was a silent but deeply interested listener,
her heart sinking more and more with each
word uttered by Mr. Lord; for as her pastor
and spiritual instructor, his expressed convictions
of truth carried great weight with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and seemed to widen the gulf between herself
and him who was the choice of her heart.</p>

<p>Her only comfort was the hope that some day
the barrier might be removed; but ah! many
long years might intervene, and who should
say that in the mean time Charlie would not
grow disheartened and weary of waiting; or,
incredulous of the love that could keep him
waiting, allow some other to usurp her place
in his affections?</p>

<p>These were depressing thoughts, and throughout
the remainder of the journey they filled
Mildred's mind almost constantly. It was only
by a determined effort that she could shake
them off and talk of other things.</p>

<p>In the course of that day and the next,
which was Friday, the other passengers dropped
off one by one, until, to her dismay, she
found herself alone with Mr. Lord for the first
time since they had left Lansdale.</p>

<p>The last to leave them was an elderly lady
who had been occupying the back seat along
with Mildred since the stage had started that
morning. When it drew up before her door,
Mr. Lord alighted and politely handed her out.
On getting in again, instead of resuming his
former seat, he took the one she had just
vacated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Mildred's heart gave a throb and the color
rushed over her face, for she foresaw what
would follow. Still she would foil him if possible,
and perhaps their numbers might be
presently again augmented as they rolled onward.</p>

<p>With that last thought in his mind also, the
gentleman was disposed to seize his opportunity
instantly. He cleared his throat, turned to his
companion, and opened his lips; but with her
back toward him she was gazing eagerly from
the window.</p>

<p>"Look, look at those maples!" she cried;
"was there ever more gorgeous coloring?
How perfectly lovely the woods are! And the
weather is delightful to-day. October is the
pleasantest month of the year for travelling, I
think."</p>

<p>"Any month and any weather would be
pleasant to me with you for my companion,"
he said, "and nothing, my dearest girl, could
make me so supremely happy as to secure you
as such for the whole journey of life."</p>

<p>She feigned not to have heard or fully understood.
"I for one have travelled quite far
enough," she responded, still keeping her face
toward the window. "I'm tired of it, and of
being so long away from the dear home-circle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Oh, I am so glad that I shall be with them to-morrow,
if all goes well!"</p>

<p>"God grant it, dear Mildred; I shall rejoice
in your happiness and theirs, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh see!" she interrupted, pointing to a
group of trees near the roadside, "what brilliant
reds and yellows! And there! what a
beautiful contrast those evergreens make!"</p>

<p>"Yes; God's works are wonderful and his
ways past finding out," he answered devoutly,
then kept silence; while for some minutes
Mildred rattled on, hardly knowing or caring
what she was saying so she might but avoid
the necessity of listening to and answering the
proposal he was evidently so desirous to make.</p>

<p>But his silence disconcerted her, he did not
seem to hear her remarks, and at length she
found herself too much embarrassed to continue
them. For five minutes neither spoke, then
he made her a formal offer of his heart and
hand, which she gently but decidedly declined,
saying she felt totally unfit for the position
he would place her in.</p>

<p>He said that in that he could not agree with
her; he had never met any one who seemed
to him so eminently fitted for the duties and
responsibilities he had asked her to assume.
"And he loved her as he never had loved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
never could love another. Would she not reconsider?
Would she not be persuaded?"</p>

<p>She told him she highly esteemed him as a
man and a minister, that she felt greatly honored
by his preference, but could not love him
in the way he wished.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "what a sad blunderer I am!
I see have spoken too soon. Yet give me a
little hope, dear girl, and I will wait patiently
and do my best to win the place in your heart
I so ardently covet."</p>

<p>She could not bring herself to acknowledge
that that place was already filled, and he
would not resign the hope of finally winning
her.</p>

<p>During the rest of that day and the morning
of the next he treated her to frequent, lengthened
discourses on the duty of every one to
live the most useful life possible, on the rare
opportunities of so doing afforded by the position
of minister's wife, and on the permanence
and sure increase of connubial love when
founded upon mutual respect and esteem,
till at length a vague fear crept over her
that he might finally succeed in proving to her
that it was her duty to resign the hope that at
some future day the barrier to her union with
the man of her choice would be swept away,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and to marry him on account of the sphere of
usefulness such a match would open to her.</p>

<p>She heard him for the most part in silence,
now and then varied by a slight nod of acquiescence
in the sentiments he expressed, yet even
from these scant tokens of favor he ventured
to take courage and to hope that her rejection
of his suit would not prove final.</p>

<p>It was a great relief to her that they were
not alone for the last ten miles that lay between
them and Pleasant Plains.</p>

<p>Could that be home&mdash;that pretty, tasteful
dwelling, embosomed in trees, shrubs, and
vines? Mildred was half in doubt, for the
house itself seemed to have grown as well as
the vegetation that environed it. But yes, the
stage was stopping: and there were father and
Rupert at the gate, mother and the rest on the
porch; every face beaming a joyous welcome.</p>

<p>How Mr. Lord envied them as the stage
whirled him rapidly away, out of sight and
hearing of the glad greetings!</p>

<p>We will not attempt to describe these: there
were close embraces, tears of joy, low-breathed
words of tenderness and love, of gratitude to
Him who had preserved a beloved child in all
her journeyings, and brought her to her home
again in safety and health; and there were
shouts of delight from the little ones, to whom
it seemed half a lifetime since sister Milly
went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"How we have missed you! and, oh, how
glad we are to have you back again!" her
mother said, looking smilingly at her, but with
glistening eyes.</p>

<p>"She's changed," said Rupert, regarding her
critically; "she's prettier than ever, and&mdash;and
something else."</p>

<p>Zillah supplied the word&mdash;"More stylish."</p>

<p>"And you! why, you are a young lady!" exclaimed
Mildred, gazing at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I'm fifteen, and taller than you, I do believe,"
returned Zillah, laughing and blushing.</p>

<p>"And how you're all grown!" Mildred went
on, glancing round the circle.</p>

<p>"Except father and mother," laughed Rupert.
"Haven't I nearly caught up to father
in height?"</p>

<p>"So you have, and I shall be very proud of
my big brother."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare, if you hain't come at last&mdash;thought
you never was a comin'!" exclaimed a
voice in Mildred's rear; and as she turned
quickly about, a toil-hardened hand seized hers
in a grasp that almost forced from her a little
cry of pain.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I have, and am very glad
to find you here, Celestia Ann. You kept
your promise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"A heap better'n you did yours. Why you
stayed more'n as long agin as you said you was
agoin' to when you went off. Had a good
time?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I'm very glad to get home."</p>

<p>"So you'd ought to be. You look right
down tired; and I reckon you are all that, and
hungry, too. Well, I'll have dinner on table in
about ten minutes;" and with the last word she
vanished in the direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p>A look of expectant delight was on every
face of the group about Mildred as the mother,
saying, "Come, dear child, you will want to
get rid of some of the dust of travel," led the
way from the room, the others all following.</p>

<p>"Why, the house has grown too," was the
young girl's delighted exclamation, as she was
ushered into an apartment she had never seen
before&mdash;large, airy, neatly and tastefully though
inexpensively furnished; white muslin curtains
at the windows, a snowy counterpane on the
bed; everything new and fresh except the
books in the hanging shelves on the wall, and
some little ornaments which she recognized as
her own peculiar property.</p>

<p>"Yes," her father answered, smiling fondly
upon her, "so much so that we shall now have
abundance of room, even with our eldest girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
at home, and we hope it will be a very long
while before she will want to run away again."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, father dear," she said, putting
her arms around his neck; "oh, if you only
knew how glad I am to get back!"</p>

<p>"This is your room, Milly; do you like it?"
the children were asking in eager tones.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, indeed! it is perfectly lovely!
But, mother, it ought to be yours; it is larger
and cheerier than yours."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are assuming to know more than
you do, my child," laughed Mrs. Keith. "I,
too, have one of the new rooms&mdash;there are six
in all&mdash;and it is in every respect quite equal to
this. But make haste with your toilet, for the
dinner bell will soon ring."</p>

<p>They lingered at the table, eating slowly,
because there was so much talking to be done&mdash;such
pleasant, cheerful chat.</p>

<p>Then came the opening of Mildred's trunk,
and the distribution of the purchases she had
been commissioned to make, and of her own
modest gifts to father, mother, brothers, and
sisters, and the more expensive ones from
Aunt Wealthy and the Dinsmore relatives.
Of these last, little Elsie's were by far the
most costly and valuable.</p>

<p>The children were wild with delight, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
parents quietly happy in their pleasure, and
gratified with the remembrances to themselves.</p>

<p>Mildred exhibited her watch and chain,
calling forth exclamations of intense admiration
and hearty congratulations.</p>

<p>"O sister Milly, how lovely!" cried Zillah;
"I never saw anything so beautiful, and I'm
so glad you have it! I don't believe there's
another lady in town who has a gold watch."</p>

<p>"No, I presume not," returned Mildred,
gazing down upon it with a pleased, but rather
absent look, "and it is extremely pretty; yet
not half so beautiful as the dear little giver."
And then she launched out into the warmest
of eulogies upon little Elsie&mdash;her loveliness of
both person and disposition.</p>

<p>"She must have loads of money to buy you
that splendid watch, and all these things for
the rest of us," remarked Cyril.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! I'd like to be in her place,"
said Ada.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't," said Mildred; "and I don't
believe you would, Ada, if you quite understood
her position."</p>

<p>"Why?" the children asked, clustering close
about their sister, with looks of surprise and
eager interest; "tell us why. It must be nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to be so rich; to own houses and lands, and all
sorts of things."</p>

<p>"Do not be too sure of that," said their
father; "though poverty has its trials, wealth
brings cares, and cannot of itself give happiness;
in fact, it has sometimes proved a curse
to its possessors. Remember our Saviour said,
'How hardly shall they that have riches enter
into the kingdom of God.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," added Mrs. Keith; "and in another
place he says, 'Take heed and beware of covetousness;
for a man's life consisteth not in the
abundance of the things which he possesseth.'"</p>

<p>"But some rich people are good, aren't
they?" queried Cyril. "I'm sure Milly said
Elsie was."</p>

<p>"But she's just a baby girl," put in Don,
"and maybe she'll get bad by the time she
grows up."</p>

<p>"Now, boys, keep quiet, can't you? and let's
hear what Milly's going to tell," said Ada.</p>

<p>Mildred glanced at the nearly emptied trunk,
the piles of clothing on the bed and chairs, and
shook her head. "Another time, children; I
ought to be putting these things in place in
the wardrobe and bureau."</p>

<p>"Oh! you're too tired. Sit down in the
rocking-chair and rest while you talk, and I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
help you afterward to arrange your things,"
Zillah said; and with a word of thanks Mildred
yielded.</p>

<p>Taking Annis on her lap, and glancing
with a half smile from one eager, expectant
face to another, "What would any one of you
sell all the rest for?" she asked.</p>

<p>Several pairs of young eyes opened wide
with astonishment. "Why, Milly, what a
question!" "Not for anything!" "Not for
all the world! You know we wouldn't!"
were the answering exclamations; and then
there were loving looks exchanged, and Don
gave Fan a hug, while Cyril squeezed her
hand and patted Annis on her curly head.</p>

<p>"It would be dreadfully lonesome not to
have any brothers or sisters!" he said, with a
long-drawn sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Little Elsie has none," said Mildred. "But
what if we had no mother, children?"</p>

<p>"Milly, don't! what makes you say such
things!" cried Fan, hastily releasing herself
from Don, and running to her mother to hide
her face in her lap with a half sob.</p>

<p>"No; what's the use?" Zillah asked huskily,
while Ada's eyes filled and the boys looked
distressed, as though the idea was too painful
to contemplate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just to convince you that little Elsie is not
so much to be envied by us. She has no
mother, has never seen her father, and does
not know whether he loves her or not."</p>

<p>"Does she show any desire to see him?"
asked Mrs. Keith, stroking Fan's hair.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, mother! yes, indeed! She talks a
great deal about him, often wishes he would
come home, and is never more interested than
when he is the theme of conversation."</p>

<p>"I hope her grandfather and his wife love
and fondle her?"</p>

<p>"Not at all; they treat her with almost unvarying
coldness and neglect!" Mildred said,
her eyes sparkling with indignant anger.</p>

<p>Then she went on to tell of various acts of
injustice and oppression to which the little
girl had been subjected since her coming to
Roselands, and to give a pathetic description of
her loneliness and unsatisfied yearning for the
love of her kindred. In conclusion, Mildred
asked, "Now would any of you change places
with her?"</p>

<p>"No, no, indeed we wouldn't! Poor dear
little thing! we're very sorry for her," the
children cried in chorus.</p>

<p>"Mother, mayn't Elsie come here and be
your little girl 'long with us?" asked Annis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should gladly take her, darling, if I
could," Mrs. Keith answered; "but she belongs
to her father, and it is he who directs
where she shall live."</p>

<p>"Tell us some more, Milly; tell about that
beautiful Viamede," entreated Ada, putting
an arm coaxingly round her sister's neck.</p>

<p>"Some other time; but now I must really
go to work and finish my unpacking."</p>

<p>"No, you must go into another room and
lie down for an hour or two," said her mother.
"You need rest and sleep; and your sisters
and I will set things to rights here."</p>

<p>Mildred objected. "Mother, dear, I have
come home to ease your burdens, not to add
to them."</p>

<p>"And which will you do by wearing yourself
out and getting sick?" asked the mother,
with a merry look and smile. "Set these
younger ones a good example by prompt obedience
to my direction. We want you bright
for a good long talk after tea."</p>

<p>"But, mother, you always have so much to
tax your time and strength, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Run away now, without another word,"
was the playful reply. "I'm neither busy nor
tired this afternoon."</p>

<p>So Mildred went, slept soundly for a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of hours, and toward tea-time came down to
the sitting-room, looking quite rested and refreshed;
very sweet and pretty, too, they all
thought, in new and tasteful attire, and with
her glossy brown hair becomingly arranged.</p>

<p>She found her mother and the older girls
sewing.</p>

<p>"How nice you look!" Zillah said, surveying
her admiringly. "That's a lovely dress, and
made so prettily! Will you let me have mine
made like it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, and help you make it, too.
Mother, how have you managed with the sewing
while I've been gone?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well, Milly. Zillah has become
quite a needle-woman, and Ada does remarkably
well, too, considering her imperfect sight.
Housework suits her best on that account.
They are dear, helpful girls&mdash;both of them."</p>

<p>"Milly, Milly," cried Cyril, rushing in from
the grounds, "come and look at our gardens,
and our hens and chickens, before it grows too
dark."</p>

<p>"The gardens aren't much to look at now,"
laughed Zillah.</p>

<p>"But she can see pretty well what they have
been, and we'll tell her the rest," returned
Cyril, leading the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, girls, we'll all go," Mrs. Keith said,
folding up her work; "the rest of the afternoon
and evening shall be a holiday, in honor
of our wanderer's return."</p>

<p>There was, in truth, little to exhibit in the
gardens now, save a few late-blooming fall
flowers; but Mildred admired them, and listened
with interest to the accounts given of
what had been raised by each little worker
during the past spring and summer.</p>

<p>And there was really a large flock of fowls,
all in fine condition, promising plenty of eggs
and poultry even through the cold winter
months; for Rupert had built a snug hen-house
to protect these feathered friends from
the inclemency of the weather.</p>

<p>"Now this way, Mildred; I want to show
you the vines I've trained over the front
porch," Rupert said.</p>

<p>As they stood looking at the vines, the front
gate opened and shut, and a firm, elastic step
came quickly up the walk. Mildred turned
and found an old acquaintance at her side.</p>

<p>"Wallace&mdash;Mr. Ormsby!" she exclaimed,
offering her hand in cordial greeting, though
the rich color surged over her face with the
sudden recollection of his parting words, spoken
a year ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; keep to the first name, please," he
said in an undertone, as he grasped her offered
hand. "Excuse so early a call, but I did not
know how to wait. It seems an age since you
went away."</p>

<p>"We are always glad to see you, Wallace,"
said Mrs. Keith. "You must stay and take
tea with us; it is nearly ready. Come, we
will all go in now, for the air is growing
chilly."</p>

<p>Ormsby was by no means loath to accept the
invitation. Mildred seemed to him lovelier
than ever, and his eyes were constantly seeking
her face, when politeness did not require him
to look elsewhere. Enchanted anew by her
charms of person, manner, and conversation,
he lingered for an hour or more after tea,
watching, hoping for an opportunity to breathe
some words into her ear which should reach
no other.</p>

<p>But parents, brothers, and sisters clustered
about her, and soon other neighbors began to
drop in to bid her welcome home&mdash;Dr. Grange
and his daughter, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Clandina'">Claudina</ins> Chetwood and her
brother Will, and one or two others of those
who were most intimate with the family. Then
a look from Mr. Keith reminding Wallace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
an important paper which should be drawn up
that evening, he took a reluctant leave.</p>

<p>He paused an instant at the gate to glance
back regretfully at the brightly lighted parlor
windows and the comfortable-looking group
within, of which Mildred was the centre.</p>

<p>A tall, muscular figure was approaching
from the opposite direction as Ormsby, turning
away with a sigh, hurried down the street
toward Mr. Keith's office. There was an exchange
of greetings as the two passed each
other. "Good-evening, Mr. Ormsby." "How
d'ye do, Sheriff?"&mdash;and each hastened on his
way.</p>

<p>The next moment the tall man was standing
where Wallace had been but now, gazing intently
in at the same group; though, in truth,
he scarcely saw any but that central figure&mdash;the
graceful, girlish form so tastefully attired;
the bright, sweet face, full of animation and
intellect. He could not take his eyes from
her&mdash;great, dark eyes, hungry and wistful&mdash;as
for many minutes he stood resting his left
hand on the top of the gate, the right arm
hanging at his side.</p>

<p>At last, with a sigh that was almost a groan,
he, too, turned and went on his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's prettier than ever&mdash;the sweetest thing
alive," he murmured half aloud, "and I'll
never forgit how good she was to me in that
awful time when even my mother couldn't
stand by me. But, for all that, 'tain't no ways
likely she cares enough for Gote Lightcap to
so much as ask if he's alive or no."</p>

</div></div>


<p>The callers departed to their own homes.
Mr. Keith called the household together, and,
as usual, closed the day with prayer and praise
and the reading of the word of God.</p>

<p>The good-nights were exchanged, and presently
Mildred sat alone in her own room,
slowly taking down her wealth of rich brown
hair, while thought, half troubled, half pleasurable,
was busy in her brain.</p>

<p>A gentle tap on the door, then it was softly
opened, and her mother stood by her side.</p>

<p>Instantly the dreamy look left Mildred's
eyes, and they were lustrous with love and joy
as she lifted them to the sweet face bending
over her.</p>

<p>"Darling mother!" she cried, hastening to
rise and bring forward the easiest chair in the
room, "I'm so glad you have come. I am
longing so for one of our old quiet talks."</p>

<p>"Ah! I knew it," Mrs Keith said, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the chair; "I saw it in your eyes, dear child,
and am as anxious for it as yourself. Oh, it is
nice to have you at home again!"</p>

<p>"And so nice to be here. Mother dear,
there have been times when I felt in sore need
of your wise, loving counsels."</p>

<p>Shaking out her abundant tresses, she seated
herself on a cushion at her mother's feet and
laid her head in her lap, as she had been wont
to do in childhood's days.</p>

<p>"Then I trust you carried your perplexities
to a wiser Friend, whose love is even greater
than that of the tenderest mother," Mrs. Keith
said, gently caressing the silken hair and the
blooming cheek.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother. Ah! what could I have done
without that Friend?"</p>

<p>Then, with blushes and tears, she poured
out the story of her love, and her refusal to
engage herself, because the chosen of her heart
was not a Christian man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith was a little surprised, a trifle
disappointed. "I had almost set my heart on
having Wallace for my future son-in-law," she
remarked in a playful tone, "and no such
objection could be brought against him."</p>

<p>"No," said Mildred, half averting her blushing
face; "he is good and noble and true&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
sincere Christian, I do believe, and I heartily
respect and like him; but, O mother! why is
it that the course of true love never will run
smooth?"</p>

<p>"I think it does sometimes; at least often
enough to prove the rule."</p>

<p>"I was in hopes it might have been out of
sight out of mind with Wallace," Mildred said
presently.</p>

<p>"No; Cupid's arrow had gone too deep for
that. But perhaps it may prove so with the
other, and you may yet learn to care for poor
Wallace."</p>

<p>"No, mother; I am sure, quite sure, that
I can never give him anything but the sisterly
affection that is already his. Mother, I know
girls who think it must be a delightful thing
to have a number of lovers, but I don't find it
so, there is so much that is painful and perplexing
connected with it."</p>

<p>"Perplexing, my child!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother. Do you&mdash;do you think it
can ever be the duty of one who cannot marry
the man of her choice to become the wife of
another because it will open to her a wider
sphere of usefulness?"</p>

<p>"Why that question, Mildred?" asked Mrs.
Keith, in grave surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because Mr.&mdash;Mr. Lord thinks I ought&mdash;that
it is my duty to&mdash;to marry him; and
though he did not convince me, he&mdash;he made
me afraid it might be."</p>

<p>A very mirthful look had come into Mrs.
Keith's eyes.</p>

<p>"My dear, silly little girl," she said, bending
down to get a better view of the blushing
face, "why did you not tell him you are quite
unfit for the position he offered you?"</p>

<p>"I did, mother," Mildred answered, with
sincere humility, "but he&mdash;still insisted. He
has somehow formed a very mistaken opinion
of me."</p>

<p>"That is a pity; but we will not let him
sacrifice himself. I shall utterly refuse consent,
and so will your father."</p>

<p>"But don't you think him a good man?"
Mildred asked, lifting her head and gazing
into her mother's eyes with a look of mingled
relief and perplexity.</p>

<p>"Very good, but very unsuitable in disposition
and in years for a husband for you, or
a son-in-law for me. His absent-mindedness
would put a great deal of care on your young
shoulders. But, my dear child, leaving the
question of his character and suitableness in
other respects entirely out of sight, the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
that you prefer another is quite sufficient of
itself to make your acceptance of his suit both
foolish and wrong. Nothing can make it
right for man or woman to marry one while
his or her heart turns more strongly to another.
As to his argument that thus a wider sphere of
usefulness would be opened to you, all I have
to say is, that it is not, cannot ever be right to
do evil that good may come."</p>

<p>Mildred drew a long sigh of relief. "O
mother, I am so thankful that you take that
view of it! and I am sure it is the right one.
You have lifted half my load, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can you not cast the other half on the
Lord?"</p>

<p>"I do try to. But, mother, what do you
think? would it be wrong for me to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Follow the dictates of your heart?" Mrs.
Keith asked, as Mildred paused, leaving the
sentence unfinished. "My child, that is a
question for you to settle with your own conscience.
You have God's holy word to guide
you, and in answer to prayer he will give you
the guidance of the Spirit also. I will only
say that it cannot be other than a dangerous
experiment for a Christian to enter into the
closest of earthly relations with one who is
living for this world alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Especially one so weak and ready to wander
out of the way as I," sighed the young
girl.</p>

<p>"Well, darling, you are young enough to
wait; and let us hope all will come right at
length. Ah! we may be sure of it, for 'we
know that all things work together for good
to them that love God; to them who are the
called according to his purpose.' But it is
growing late, and you ought to be resting
after your long journey." And with a tender
good-night they parted.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord filled his own pulpit the next day,
both morning and evening, preaching with
acceptance to his flock.</p>

<p>Mildred attended both services, but carefully
avoided meeting the speaker's eye during the
sermon, and slipped out of the church as
quickly as possible after the benediction was
pronounced. Each time she was delayed a
little in her exit by the necessity of stopping
for a shaking of hands and the exchange of a
few words with friends and neighbors who
stepped forward to greet and welcome her
home; but others were crowding about the
minister with the same kindly intent, and thus
unconsciously assisted in her desired avoidance
of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>She was little less anxious to escape Wallace
Ormsby, but in that was not so successful: he
walked by her side in the morning, as far as
their roads lay in the same direction; yet as
Don held fast to one of Mildred's hands and
Fan to the other, his talk was only on topics
of general interest, the sermon, the Sunday-school,
etc.</p>

<p>In the evening, as she stepped into the vestibule,
she saw Wallace waiting near the outer
door, and read his purpose in his eyes. She
turned to Zillah, who was close beside her,
seized her hand, and, holding it fast, whispered
in her ear, "We'll walk home together.
Be sure to keep close to me."</p>

<p>Zillah nodded with a roguish smile, and, to
Wallace's no small annoyance, did as requested.
Offering one arm to Mildred, he could do no
less than ask Zillah to take the other, which
she did with alacrity. And all the way home
she kept up a constant stream of talk, Mildred
listening with inward amusement, Wallace
wondering whether it was with a purpose, and
wishing she was somewhere out of earshot of
what he wanted to say to her sister.</p>

<p>The Keiths neither paid nor received visits
on the Sabbath: so he bade the girls good
evening at their father's door, and quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
wended his way to his lonely bachelor quarters
over the office; while the girls, listening
to his departing footsteps, exchanged a few
words of congratulation on the one side and
thanks on the other, mingled with a little
girlish laughter at his expense.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Mildred, as they were about
separating for the night, "I will be up in good
season to-morrow morning and get breakfast,
as Celestia Ann will of course be busy with
her washing."</p>

<p>"Indeed you'll do no such thing," cried
Zillah. "Ada and I will get breakfast and
dinner to-morrow, and you're not to so much
as put your nose into the kitchen. You're to
play lady for a week at least, while you look
on and see how nicely we can manage without
you."</p>

<p>"I've played lady long enough, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother, isn't it to be as I've said?" demanded
Zillah, not giving Mildred time to
conclude her sentence.</p>

<p>"Yes, Milly, you and I can find enough to
do out of the kitchen for the present, and we
will let these young cooks have a chance to
show what they can do," Mrs. Keith said,
looking from one to the other with a proud,
fond, motherly smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I like to cook," put in Ada. "Milly, I
can make nice cakes and desserts; they all say
so. And Zillah and I made pickles and preserves
this fall, mother only overseeing and
telling us how. Celestia Ann wanted to turn
us out of the kitchen and do it all herself, but
mother said no&mdash;we must learn how."</p>

<p>Monday morning found the Keith household
like a hive of cheerful, busy bees. Mrs.
Keith and Mildred, busied together in the
dining-room, washing and putting away the
breakfast china and silver, which were never
allowed to go into the kitchen, laid plans for
the fall and winter sewing.</p>

<p>"I have been learning to cut and fit,
mother," Mildred said; "taking lessons of
one of Aunt Dinsmore's servants who is excellent
at it; so now, if you like, I shall fit all
the dresses of the family, beginning to-day
with Ada's and Zillah's calicoes."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad, my dear," Mrs. Keith
replied, "for really there is not a competent
dressmaker in town. But I see I shall have
to take care that you do not overwork yourself,"
she added, with an affectionate smile.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Zillah, putting her head in
at the door, "we're nearly out of salt and
sugar both. Who shall go for them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cyril and Don; it is a lovely day, and
they will enjoy the walk. Mildred, there will
be some little articles wanted about our dressmaking;
suppose you go also and select them.
The walk will be good for you, and you will
like to see how the town has grown in your
absence."</p>

<p>Fan and Annis put in an eager plea to be
permitted to be of the party.</p>

<p>Mildred demurred. "I'm afraid, Annis, darling,
you can't walk fast enough. Sister Milly
wants to come back quickly because of the
sewing."</p>

<p>"Never mind that; we will not deprive the
darling of so great a pleasure merely to save a
few minutes," the mother said, with a loving
smile at the little, disappointed face, which
instantly grew bright again. "Linger a little
on the way, Mildred, and enjoy the sweet air
and the beauty of the woods. These things
were given for our enjoyment."</p>

<p>"Dearest mother! always so kind and
thoughtful for each one of us," Mildred whispered,
bending over her mother's chair to kiss
the still fresh and blooming cheek.</p>

<p>Mildred had returned to her home entirely
restored to health, and full of the old energy,
and with a desire to accomplish a great deal in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the way of relieving her mother's cares and
burdens and promoting the material interests
of each member of the family of loved ones.
She had planned to do a certain amount of
sewing that day, and was eager to begin; but
she was learning the difficult lesson of readiness
to cheerfully yield her own plans and
wishes to those of others, remembering that
"even Christ pleased not himself."</p>

<p>With a face bright and sweet as the lovely
October morning she made herself ready and
set out on her errand; Fan clinging to one
hand, Annis to the other, while the two little
brothers now brought up the rear, now hastened
on in front, or trotted alongside, as inclination
dictated.</p>

<p>"Yonder comes the sheriff; we'll meet him
in a minute," said Cyril presently.</p>

<p>"Who is sheriff now?" asked Mildred.</p>

<p>"Gotobed Lightcap. He's learned to write
with his left hand, and they 'lected him sheriff
last week. Everybody voted for him because
they were so sorry for him. Wasn't it nice?
Mother says the folks in this town are the
kindest people in the world, she thinks."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was nice and kind," Mildred responded,
looking a little curiously at the tall,
broad-shouldered, masculine figure approaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
from the opposite direction. In dress, in
gait, in the intelligence of his countenance, he
was an improvement upon the Gotobed of two
years ago.</p>

<p>In another moment they had met. He
lifted his hat with his left hand and bowed a
little awkwardly, while a deep-red flush suffused
his swarthy face.</p>

<p>Mildred colored slightly too, but greeted
him cordially and without any other show of
embarrassment, inquiring after his health and
that of his family.</p>

<p>"We're all as well as common, thank ye,
Miss Keith," he said, devouring her face with
his eyes, "and I hope you're the same, and as
glad to git back as all your friends is to see
ye."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I do find it nice to be at home
again," she responded, bowing and passing on.</p>

<p>Their way lay past her father's office.
Ormsby, looking up from the deed he was
drawing and catching a glimpse of her graceful
figure as it hurried by, sprang up and
stepped to the door just in time to see her go
into Chetwood &amp; Mocker's.</p>

<p>He was on the watch for her as she came
out again, and waylaid her with an invitation
to drive out with him that afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, with a winsome
smile; "I fully appreciate your kindness, but&mdash;don't
you think, after my long vacation, I
ought now to stay at home and work? I had
planned to do a good deal of sewing to-day."</p>

<p>"But the weather is so fine, and we ought
to take advantage of these lovely days, which
will so soon be gone," he said persuasively.
"Let the sewing wait; 'twill be just the thing
for the stormy days that will soon be upon us.
I may come for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, laughing and nodding
good-by.</p>

<p>Zillah met her at the door, her eyes dancing
with fun. "Mr. Lord's in the parlor with
mother, and you're wanted there too."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Mildred; but, throwing
off her hat in the hall, she went at once to
meet the dreaded ordeal.</p>

<p>The gentleman rose on her entrance, and
with beaming eyes and outstretched hand came
eagerly forward to greet her. "My dear Miss
Mildred, I have been telling your mother of
my plans and wishes, and asking her consent
and approval of my&mdash;the proposal I made to
you the other day; and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And she has declined to give them?" Mildred
said, allowing him to take her hand for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
an instant, then hastily withdrawing it, her
eyes seeking her mother's face, while her own
flushed crimson.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have been trying for the last half
hour to convince Mr. Lord how entirely unsuitable
you are for the place and position he
offers you," Mrs. Keith answered in a grave,
quiet tone. "Come and sit down here by
me," making room for her on the sofa by her
side, "and we will try together to convince
him."</p>

<p>"That will be no easy task," remarked the
middle-aged lover, as Mildred hastened to accept
her mother's invitation; then, standing
before them and fixing his eyes admiringly
upon the blushing, downcast face of the
maiden, he went on to plead his cause with
all the force and eloquence of which he was
master.</p>

<p>He spoke very rapidly, as if fearful of
interruption, and determined to forestall all
objections, Mildred listening in some embarrassment
and with much inward disgust and
impatience.</p>

<p>These changed directly to almost overpowering
mirthfulness, as the man, perhaps finding
his false teeth, to which he was yet not
fully accustomed, impeding his speech to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
extent, in his intense interest in his subject,
hardly conscious of the act, jerked them out,
twirled them about in his fingers for an instant,
then with a sudden recollection thrust them in
again, his face turning scarlet with mortification
and the last word faltering on his tongue.</p>

<p>Controlling her inclination to laugh, Mildred
seized her opportunity. "Mr. Lord," she said,
with gentle firmness, "please do not waste any
more words on this subject, for I have no other
answer to give you to-day than that which I
gave before. Nor shall I ever have any other.
I highly respect and esteem you, feel myself
greatly honored by your preference, but&mdash;it is
utterly out of my power to feel toward you as
a woman should toward the man with whom
she links her destiny for life."</p>

<p>With the last word she rose and would have
left the room, but he intercepted her. "Not
now, I suppose. Ah, my foolish impatience,
which has a second time betrayed me! But I
will wait&mdash;wait years, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is useless, quite useless, I assure you,"
she interrupted, in some impatience. "To
convince you of that, I will acknowledge that&mdash;that
my heart has already been given to
another."</p>

<p>Hiding her blushing face in her hands, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
hurried from the room, leaving to her mother
the task of consoling the rejected suitor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith afterward reported that he stood
for a moment as if struck dumb with surprise
and dismay; then muttering, "Wallace
Ormsby&mdash;it must be he," was rushing bare-headed
from the house, when she called him
back and gave him his hat, with a consolatory
word or two, which he did not seem to hear,
as he merely turned about without replying,
and walked rapidly away with the hat in his
hand.</p>

<p>Mildred, hurrying to the privacy of her own
room with cheeks aflame and an indignant
light in her brown eyes, found herself intercepted
by Zillah.</p>

<p>"Good girl not to say yes," cried the latter
gayly, putting her arm round Mildred's neck
and kissing her.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Zillah? You don't
know anything about it," Mildred said, repulsing
her slightly and averting her face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Mr. Lord's been asking you to
marry him&mdash;I knew by his looks that that was
what he came for&mdash;and I'm glad you won't
have him. He's nice enough as a minister,
but too old and ugly and awkward for a husband
for my pretty sister Milly. Wallace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Ormsby would be far more suitable, in my
humble opinion," she added, with a merry
twinkle in her deep blue eyes.</p>

<p>Mildred looked at her and took a sudden
resolution. "Come in here," she said, pushing
open her room door. "Zillah, can you
keep a secret?"</p>

<p>"Suppose you try me," was the laughing
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"I will. I am sure I may trust you."</p>

<p>So Zillah presently knew how matters stood
between her sister and Charlie Landreth, and
Mildred felt that she had another hearty sympathizer,
and was safe from any more teasing
about Wallace Ormsby from that quarter.</p>

<p>As for the latter, he of course improved his
chance as they drove together that afternoon
over the prairies and through the beautiful
autumn woods; and Mildred had the painful
task of crushing his hopes as she had already
crushed those of her older admirer.</p>

</div></div>


<p>"O Wallace, forgive me! Not for worlds
would I have hurt you so if&mdash;if I could have
helped it." Mildred's voice was full of tears,
and she ended with a sigh that was half a sob.</p>

<p>His head was turned away so that she could
not catch so much as a glimpse of his face.</p>

<p>"It is just what I expected when you went
away," he answered huskily; "but I don't
blame you. I've always known I wasn't half
good enough for such a girl as you."</p>

<p>"No, don't say that!" she cried, almost eagerly;
"you are good enough for anybody,
Wallace; you are noble and true and brave;
and father says that with your talent and industry
you are sure to make your mark in the
world."</p>

<p>"What do I care for that now?" he returned
bitterly. "You have been my inspiration, Mildred;
it was for you&mdash;to win you and to make
you rich and happy&mdash;that I have studied and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
toiled and planned, and now you are lost to
me!" he groaned.</p>

<p>"O Wallace!" she murmured softly, "I had
hoped yours was a higher ambition&mdash;that you
had consecrated your time, talents, everything,
to Him who gave them, and whose love is better
beyond comparison than any or all earthly
loves."</p>

<p>"You are right," he said, after a moment's
silence, and his voice was low and humble, "it
ought to be so; it shall be so henceforward.
But&mdash;O Mildred, Mildred, what happiness can
there be in life without you!"</p>

<p>"I will be your sister, Wallace; I have a real
sisterly affection for you."</p>

<p>"I ought to be thankful for even that&mdash;I
shall be some day; but O Mildred! now it
seems like giving me a crumb when I am starving&mdash;so
famished that nothing less than a whole
loaf will relieve the dreadful pain. And this
other fellow that has won you away from me&mdash;will
he&mdash;will he be taking you away from us
soon?"</p>

<p>"No, Wallace, not soon, perhaps never," she
answered in low, quivering tones.</p>

<p>He turned and faced her with an inquiring
look. "I have misunderstood. I thought you
said the&mdash;the affection was mutual."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will tell you all about it," she said after
a moment's embarrassed silence. "I think I
owe you the confidence as some slight amends
for the pain I have unwillingly caused you."</p>

<p>Then in a few words she told him just how
matters stood between Charlie Landreth and
herself, withholding only the name of her favored
suitor.</p>

<p>When she had finished, silence fell between
them for many minutes. Mildred's eyes were
cast down, Wallace's gazing straight before him
or taking note of the inequalities of the road.
They were nearing the town when at last he
spoke again.</p>

<p>"I thank you for your confidence, dear Mildred,
(you will let me call you that this once?)
You know I shall never abuse it. I am sorry
for your sake that he is not all you could wish.
But don't let it make you unhappy. I couldn't
bear that. And I hope and believe it will all
come right in the end."</p>

<p>"Wallace, how good and noble you are!"
she cried, looking at him with eyes brimming
with tears. "We will always be friends&mdash;good,
true friends, shall we not?" she asked,
almost beseechingly, holding out her hand to
him.</p>

<p>He caught it in his and pressed it to his lips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
with a low, passionate cry, "O Mildred! and
can I never be more than that to you!"</p>

<p>An hour later Mrs. Keith found her eldest
daughter in her own room, crying bitterly.</p>

<p>"My dear child! what is the matter?" she
asked in concern.</p>

<p>"O mother, mother, I seem to have been
born to make others unhappy!" sobbed Mildred.</p>

<p>"I have often thought you were born to be
the great comfort and blessing of your mother's
life, and have thanked God with my whole
heart for this his good gift to me," the mother
responded, with a loving caress; and a glad
smile broke like sunlight through the rain of
tears.</p>

<p>"Mother, what a blessed comforter you are!"
sighed Mildred, resting her wet cheek on her
mother's shoulder. "Mother, Wallace loves
me and seems almost heart-broken because I&mdash;I
cannot return it. And he is such a dear,
noble fellow, too&mdash;worthy of a far better wife
than I would make!"</p>

<p>"We must try to convince him of that, and
make him glad of his fortunate escape," Mrs.
Keith said in her playful tone.</p>

<p>Mildred laughed in spite of herself, but a
little hysterically; then growing grave again:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
"But, mother, he does really seem heart-broken,
and it is dreadful to me to have caused
such suffering to one so deserving of happiness."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it, my dear, and I feel for
you both; but trouble does not spring from
the ground; all our trials are sent us, for some
good purpose, by that best and dearest of all
friends, who knows just what each one of us
needs, and never makes a mistake. I am sorry
for you both, but I do not think either is to
blame, and I believe you will come out of the
trial better and happier Christians than you
would ever have been without it.</p>

<p>"Now, dear child, I shall leave you, that you
may be able to spend a few minutes with that
best Friend before joining us downstairs. Try
to cast all your care on Him, because he bids
you do so, and because it is for your happiness."</p>

<p>Mildred followed the kind, wise advice;
then, having done what she could to remove
the traces of her tears, hastened to join the
family at the tea-table in answer to the bell.</p>

<p>Her mother adroitly contrived to take the
attention of the others from her, and no one
noticed that she had been weeping.</p>

<p>The faces and the chat were cheerful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
bright, as was almost invariably the case in
that family circle, and the joy of being among
them again after so long an absence soon restored
Mildred to her wonted serenity.</p>

<p>They discussed their plans for study and
work for the coming fall and winter months.
The town was still destitute of a competent
teacher; efforts had been made to procure one
from the Eastern States, but as yet without
success; therefore Mildred proposed to resume
her duties as governess to her younger brothers
and sisters: she could assist Rupert, too, in
some branches, and wished to perfect herself
in some, and to improve her mind by a course
of reading.</p>

<p>Then, as always, there was the family sewing,
beside various housekeeping cares of which
she desired to relieve her mother.</p>

<p>Zillah listened with a mirthful look to Mildred's
long list, and at its conclusion asked,
with a merry laugh, "Is that all, Milly?"</p>

<p>Mildred echoed the laugh, and blushingly
acknowledged that it was very much easier
to plan than to execute, and she feared she
should fall very far short of accomplishing all
she desired.</p>

<p>"Yes," said her father, "but it is best to aim
high, for we are pretty sure never to do more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
than we lay out for ourselves, or even so
much."</p>

<p>"But if Milly undertakes all the work, father,
what are Ada and I to do?" queried Zillah, in
a sprightly tone.</p>

<p>"She'll be glad enough before long to let
us help with it," remarked Ada quietly. "If
she'd had breakfast and dinner to get to-day
she couldn't have walked out this morning;
and I don't think she could have taken time to
drive out this afternoon if she had been the
only one to help mother with the sewing."</p>

<p>"No, that is quite true," said Mildred, smiling
at Ada's serious face, "and I'm delighted to
find what helpful girls you two have become,
for there is abundance of work for us
all."</p>

<p>"Enough to leave us no excuse for idleness,"
added the mother, "but not so much that any
one of us need feel overburdened; for 'many
hands make light work.'"</p>

<p>"Especially when the head manager knows
how to bring system to her aid," concluded
Mr. Keith, with an affectionate, appreciative
glance at his wife.</p>

<p>"Yes," she rejoined brightly, "very little
can be accomplished without that, but with it
I think we shall do nicely."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>The little ones were asking when lessons
were to begin.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if mother approves," answered
Mildred.</p>

<p>Her father smiled approval, remarking,
"Promptness is one of Mildred's virtues; one
we may all cultivate with profit."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, Stuart," Mrs. Keith
said, "and yet it is sometimes best to make
haste slowly. Mildred, my child, you have
had a long, wearisome journey, and may lawfully
rest for at least this one week."</p>

<p>"And we all need our new clothes made
up," remarked Ada. "Mother, have Milly
make your black silk dress first."</p>

<p>Mildred and Zillah chimed in at once, "Oh
yes! certainly mother's dress must be the very
first thing to be attended to."</p>

<p>"I can fit it to-night," said Mildred.</p>

<p>"And I cut off the skirt and run the breadths
together," added Zillah.</p>

<p>"Come, come, you are entirely too fast,"
laughed Mrs. Keith. "I will not have any
one of you trying her eyes with sewing on
black at night. We will all work this evening
on the calicoes begun to-day, and Milly shall
fit a calico for me before she tries her hand on
the silk. But we will give this week to sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and reading. Cyril can read nicely now, and
he and Rupert shall take turns reading aloud
to us. Lessons shall begin next Monday."</p>

<p>Aside from her desire to be as helpful as
possible to her dear ones, Mildred felt that
constant employment for head and hands was
the best earthly antidote for her present griefs
and anxieties. So she plunged into study and
work, and gave herself little time for thought
about anything else, and her mother, understanding
her motive, not only did not oppose,
but encouraged her in that course.</p>

<p>Some new books she had brought in her
trunk proved a rare treat to the entire family,
and work, enlivened now by the reading of
these and now by cheerful chat, was decidedly
enjoyable.</p>

<p>There were many calls, too, from old friends
and acquaintances, and so the week slipped
away very quickly and pleasantly.</p>

<p>Saturday's mail brought Mildred a letter
from Charlie Landreth, which gave her both
pain and pleasure.</p>

<p>The ardent love to her that breathed in
every line sent a thrill of joy to her heart; yet
it bled for him in his deep grief for the loss of
his sister; grief unassuaged by the consolations
of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Her prayers for him went up with increased
fervor. Earnestly, importunately, she besought
the Lord to comfort him in this great sorrow,
and to make it the means of leading him to a
saving knowledge of Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>Then she sat down and answered his letter
with one that through all its maidenly modesty
and reserve breathed a tender sympathy that
was as balm to his wounds, a cordial to his
fainting spirit, when at length it reached him.</p>

<p>Mildred desired to have no secrets from her
wise and dearly-loved mother; both Charlie's
letter and her own were carried to her, and the
latter submitted to her approval ere it went on
its mission of consolation.</p>

<p>This communication from him whose love
found a response in her own heart did good
service in banishing from her mind, in great
measure, disturbing thought about the other
two.</p>

<p>For some weeks they absented themselves
from the house, then gradually resumed their
former intimacy with the family, Mildred
meeting them, when compelled by circumstance,
without embarrassment, but avoiding
a meeting when she could without seeming to
do so purposely.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="big">A DELIGHTFUL SURPRISE.</span></p>


<p class="mt2">"There is a letter, my dear, which concerns
you quite as much as myself," Mr. Keith said,
putting it into his wife's hand. "It gives information
which perhaps, for several reasons,
it may be as well for us to keep to ourselves
for the present," he added, with a smile.
"That is why I kept it back until now that we
are alone."</p>

<p>They had retired to their own room for the
night, and the little ones who shared it with
them were fast asleep.</p>

<p>"From Uncle Dinsmore!" Mrs. Keith exclaimed,
recognizing the hand-writing at a
glance.</p>

<p>Her husband watched her face with interest
and some curiosity as she read, a slight smile
on his lips and in his eyes.</p>

<p>She looked up presently with hers shining.
"How good, how wonderfully good and kind
they always are!"</p>

<p>"Almost too kind," he responded, his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
clouding a little. "At least I wish there was
no occasion for receiving such favors. I should
have been tempted to decline, had I been consulted
beforehand. But it would hardly do
now that the goods are almost here. We could
not well send them back."</p>

<p>"No; certainly that is not to be thought of
for a moment," she said, lifting to his, eyes
smiling through tears. "We must follow the
Golden Rule, Stuart, and accept their kind assistance
in educating our children just as we
would wish them to accept ours were our situations
reversed."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, heaving a sigh, "doubtless
you take the right view of it; but&mdash;ah!
Marcia, wife, 'it is more blessed to give than
to receive.'"</p>

<p>"It is indeed, my dear husband, and we
will not refuse them that blessedness now, but
receive their kindnesses in the spirit in which
they are offered, hoping that we may have our
turn some of these days. Shall we not?"</p>

<p>He gave a silent assent. "Do you not agree
with me that it will be well to keep the matter
a secret from the children until the boxes
arrive?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed! we will not let even Mildred
know. It will be such a delightful surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to her, dear child! for though she has
uttered no word of complaint, I am sure it
must have been a great disappointment to her
that you could not furnish her with a piano
this fall to enable her to keep up her music.
Now she can do that and teach her sisters too."</p>

<p>"And her playing will be a great treat to us
all," added Mr. Keith, with a smile that spoke
volumes of fatherly affection and pride in his
first-born.</p>

<p>"And then the books! what delightful times
we shall have over them!" she added, her eyes
sparkling; "what a help they will be in cultivating
our children's minds! I think our dear
girl must have completely won her way into
the hearts of my uncle and cousin Horace."</p>

<p>"As her mother did before her," he responded,
with a light happy laugh.</p>

<p>When preparing to leave Ohio for the wilds
of Indiana, Mr. Keith had sold most of their
heavy articles of furniture, among them the
piano. Its loss had been greatly lamented in
the family, especially by the older girls and
Rupert. The purchase of another had become
a darling project with him, and to that end he
had worked and saved till he had now quite a
little hoard, earned mostly by the sale of fruits,
vegetables, and fowls of his own raising; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
mother paying him for these at the market
price, and whatever surplus he had finding
ready sale at the stores.</p>

<p>The lad was very industrious and painstaking,
generally very successful in what he undertook&mdash;as
such people are apt to be&mdash;and
while generous to others spent little on himself.</p>

<p>Since Mildred's return, the desire for a
piano was stronger than ever: there was not
one in the town, nor an organ, or any kind of
keyed instrument; so that there was no chance
for them to hear her play and judge of her
improvement; and worse still, she would be in
danger, from want of practice, of losing all
she had gained. But pianos cost a great deal
in those days, and Mr. Keith could not just
now spare the money to make the purchase
and pay the heavy cost of transportation.</p>

<p>Money was scarce in that region then, business
carried on very largely by barter. This
made it easier for him to be at the expense of
enlarging his house than to pay for something
that must come from a distance.</p>

<p>There was little or no fretting or complaint
over this state of things, but the children often
talked longingly of the good time coming,
when father would be able, with the help of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
what they could earn and save, to send for a
piano.</p>

<p>That time seemed to be brought a little
nearer by an act of thoughtful kindness on the
part of their dear Aunt Wealthy. She had
set apart from her income a certain sum which
she engaged to send to their mother, at regular
intervals, to be divided among them as
pocket-money. The dear old lady could
hardly have devised anything that would have
given more pleasure. The news, as announced
by Mildred on the day of her arrival, was received
with demonstrations of wild delight,
and evidently the little ones now considered
themselves moneyed individuals, taking great
pride and pleasure in consulting together, or
with father and mother, as to the disposal of
their incomes.</p>

<p>This opened up to the careful Christian
parents a new opportunity for the study of the
natural character of each of their children, and
the curbing of wrong inclinations, whether toward
extravagance or penuriousness.</p>

<p>One day, several weeks after Mildred's return,
Rupert came in near the dinner hour,
and drawing his mother aside, whispered
something in her ear. There was a look of
covert delight in his face, and his eyes sparkled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
as he added, "One's long, low and broad,
mother; can only be one thing, I think&mdash;just
the thing we're all wanting so much. But
where could it come from?"</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose?" she answered
merrily. "Well, the instant you are done
your dinner you may go down and see them
brought up."</p>

<p>"But father said it was your wish and his to
make it a complete surprise to the children."</p>

<p>"Mildred included?" laughed his mother;
"you are so much older than she. I will manage
it. They shall all be out of the way while
we unpack."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith came in presently, and with his
arrival the call to dinner.</p>

<p>Mildred looked curiously at Rupert several
times during the meal, wondering at his unaccustomed
air of importance, the half-exultant,
meaning glance he now and then sent across
the table to one or the other of their parents,
and the haste with which he swallowed his
food and hurried from the table and the
house, having asked to be excused, as he had
business of importance to attend to.</p>

<p>"Dear me, what airs!" laughed Zillah, as he
whisked out of the room. "One would think
he was a man, sure enough."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Girls," said Mrs. Keith, "I want you to
take the little ones out for a walk this afternoon.
It is a bright day and the walking
good, and if you are all well wrapped up, you
will not feel the cold."</p>

<p>"Not if they go at once," put in Mr. Keith.</p>

<p>"Run away and make yourselves ready, all
of you."</p>

<p>"The party will be large enough without
me, won't it, mother?" queried Mildred.
"You know I have a piece of sewing on
hand that I am very desirous to finish before
night."</p>

<p>"Let it go, child; you need air and exercise
far more than I do the dress," was the kind
and smiling rejoinder.</p>

<p>Then came a chorus of entreaties from all
the children that mother would go too.</p>

<p>But she would not hear of it, had a matter
of importance to attend to at home; perhaps,
if to-morrow should prove pleasant, she would
go with them then.</p>

<p>And so with smiles and merry, loving words
she helped to make them ready and sent them
on their way.</p>

<p>Barely in time, for hardly were they out of
sight when a wagon drove up with two large,
weighty looking boxes. Rupert and two men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
beside the driver, were in the vehicle also, and
it took all their strength, with Mr. Keith's
added, to lift and carry the boxes into the
house.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is a piano! I know it is!" cried
Rupert, as they set down in the hall the box
he had described to his mother.</p>

<p>"A pianer did ye say?" queried one of the
men, as for a moment they all stood panting
from their exertions and gazing down upon the
burden they had just deposited upon the floor.
"Let's get it open quick then, for I never see
one in my life."</p>

<p>Rupert ran for the hatchet, and in another
five minutes the lid was off the box, and all
remaining doubt vanished.</p>

<p>"It is, it is!" cried the lad, fairly capering
about the room in his delight. "Oh, what a
joyful surprise for the girls and all of us!
But where on earth did it come from?
Father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had nothing to do with it, my son," Mr.
Keith asserted with a grave earnestness that
precluded the idea that he might be jesting.</p>

<p>The boy looked bewildered, then disappointed.
"There's been some mistake, I'm
afraid. Perhaps there's another family of our
name somewhere in this region, and&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>But his mother whispered a word in his
ear and his face grew radiant. "Is that it?
O mother, how good they are!"</p>

<p>"Let's git the thing out and see what it's
like," said the man who had spoken before.</p>

<p>The others eagerly assented, and set to work
at once, Mr. Keith giving assistance and directions,
Mrs. Keith pointing out the place in the
parlor where she wished it to stand.</p>

<p>"You kin play, I 'spose, Mrs. Keith. Won't
you give us a tune?" was the eager request
when their task was ended.</p>

<p>Smilingly she seated herself and played
"Yankee Doodle" with variations.</p>

<p>They were delighted. "First-rate!" commented
the one who seemed to act as chief
spokesman of the party. "Now, ma'am, if
you please, won't you strike up 'Hail
Columby.'"</p>

<p>She good-naturedly complied, added "Star
Spangled Banner," then rose from the instrument.</p>

<p>They thanked her warmly, saying they felt
well paid for bringing "the thing" in.</p>

<p>"You must come in again some day, if you
enjoy hearing it," she said with gracious sweetness.
"I think you will find my daughter a
better performer than I am."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yours is plenty good enough for us," they
answered, bowing themselves out.</p>

<p>"It is a very sweet-toned instrument," she
remarked, running her fingers over the keys;
"a most magnificent present. How delighted
Mildred and the rest will be!"</p>

<p>"I am eager to witness it," her husband
said with a smile. "It is indeed a most valuable
gift, and nothing could have been more
acceptable."</p>

<p>"They're the kindest, most generous relations
anybody ever had," added Rupert emphatically.
"What's in that other box? shan't
we open it now?"</p>

<p>"Books," answered his mother. "Yes, we
may as well open it and spread them out ready
for Mildred's inspection. Most of them belong
to her."</p>

<p>This done Mrs. Keith again seated herself
at the piano.</p>

<p>The young people had taken a pretty long
walk, moving briskly to keep themselves warm,
for the November air was frosty, and were
now returning in gay spirits, eyes sparkling
and cheeks glowing with health and happiness,
while the tongues of the little ones ran fast,
and a joyous shout or a silvery laugh rang out
now and then; for the greater part of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
way lay not through the streets of the town,
but on its outskirts&mdash;along the river bank,
through the groves of saplings, and over still
unoccupied prairie land. When they came
where there were houses and people to be disturbed
by their noise, their mirth subsided a
little, and they spoke to each other in subdued
tones.</p>

<p>As they drew near home, unaccustomed, surprising
sounds greeted their astonished ears.</p>

<p>"Oh, what's that music?" cried the little
ones, "such pretty music!"</p>

<p>"Why, it sounds like a piano!" exclaimed
the older ones; "but where could it come
from?" and they rushed tumultuously into the
house, even Mildred forgetting the staid propriety
of her years.</p>

<p>The parlor door stood open, and&mdash;yes, there
it was&mdash;a beautiful piano, mother's skilful fingers
bringing out its sweetest tones, father and
Rupert standing enraptured close beside her,
and Celestia Ann, sleeves rolled up, dish-towel
in hand, eyes dancing, and mouth stretched in
a broad grin, stationed at the farther end.</p>

<p>"Well, I never! where on airth did the
critter come from?" she exclaimed just as the
others came upon the scene. "I never see the
like, I never did!" she went on. "I just ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
down town of an arrant, and I'd come home
again and in the back door and begun to wash
up them dishes, when I heered this agoin', and
come in to find out what under the sun was
agoin' on."</p>

<p>But no one seemed to hear a word she said;
the children were jumping and careering about
the room in frantic delight, clapping their
hands, pouring out questions and exclamations.
"Oh, aren't you glad? aren't you glad?"
"Isn't it a beauty?" "It's just too nice for
anything!" "Who did send it?"</p>

<p>Mildred stood silently gazing at it, her
eyes full of glad tears. Father and Rupert
were watching her, taking no notice of the
others.</p>

<p>"Well, dear?" her mother said, whirling
about on the piano stool and looking up into
her face with tender, loving eyes.</p>

<p>"O mother, it is too much!" she cried, the
tears beginning to fall. "Uncle Dinsmore
sent it, I know; and I do believe it's one of
the very two I liked the best of all we saw.
He bought the other for themselves and this
for us."</p>

<p>"For you, dear; but indeed it is, he says,
not his own gift, but Cousin Horace's. The
books are from him&mdash;our kind, generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
uncle." And she pointed to them where they
lay piled high upon the table.</p>

<p>"Books too!" Mildred exclaimed in increased
astonishment and delight.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has marked out a course of reading
for you&mdash;subject to your father's and my approval&mdash;and
sent the necessary books and some
others beside."</p>

<p>While his wife was speaking Mr. Keith had
drawn near and put an arm about Mildred's
waist; and now she fairly broke down, and
hiding her face on her father's shoulder, sobbed
aloud.</p>

<p>The children were immediately awed into
silence. They gathered around her, asking in
half-frightened tones, "Milly, Milly, what's
the matter? are you sorry the piano's come?
We thought you'd be so glad."</p>

<p>"And so I am," she said, lifting her head
and smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>Her mother vacated the stool, her father
seated her thereon, and hastily wiping away
her tears, she sent her fingers flying over the
keys in a lively merry tune that set the children
to jumping and dancing more wildly
than before.</p>

<p>"My dear child, you have improved wonderfully,"
Mrs. Keith said, as Mildred concluded
a much longer and more difficult piece of music
than the one with which she had begun.</p>

<p>"She has indeed! I'm quite proud of her
performance," echoed Mr. Keith.</p>

<p>"She does make terrible fine music," put in
Celestia Ann; "but I wisht she'd stop a bit, or
them dishes o' mine 'll never git washed."</p>

<p>"And I must go to the office," said Mr.
Keith, looking at his watch, and glancing
about in search of his hat.</p>

<p>"And I to my sewing," added Mildred, rising.</p>

<p>The children entreated somewhat clamorously
for more, but yielded their wish at once
on mother's decision that they must wait till
after tea.</p>

<p>"Oh, the books!" cried Mildred, springing
toward them with an eager gesture. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
no," turning away with a half sigh, "I must
not take time to even look at them now."</p>

<p>"Yes, you may," her mother said smilingly;
"glance at the titles, and dip in here and there,
just to whet your appetite; read this note from
your uncle, too, and then we can talk over your
plans for mental culture, while busy with our
needles."</p>

<p>"Always the same kind, indulgent mother,"
Mildred said, with a look of grateful love. "I
will do so, then, and try to work fast enough
afterwards to make up for lost time."</p>

<p>Half an hour later she joined her mother
and sisters, who were all sewing industriously.</p>

<p>"Such a nice note, mother. Shall I read it
to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like. I always enjoy uncle's
letters."</p>

<p>"It sounds just like his talk," Mildred said
when she had done reading, "saying the kindest
things half jestingly, half earnestly. But the
idea of his thinking I must have wondered
that he gave me no special parting gift!&mdash;when
he was all the time heaping favors upon me."</p>

<p>"But it was Cousin Horace who gave the
piano," said Ada.</p>

<p>"Yes; uncle the books. And now I must
strive to show my appreciation of their kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
by making the best possible use of both
presents."</p>

<p>"For your own improvement and that of
others," added her mother. "I want you to
lend them, one at a time, to Effie Prescott and
poor Gotobed Lightcap."</p>

<p>"What about him, mother?" Mildred asked,
taking up her sewing. "The children told me
he had been elected sheriff."</p>

<p>"Yes; I was very glad. He deserves every
encouragement, for he is trying hard to educate
himself, and I really hope some day may
be able to enter one of the learned professions."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" Mildred exclaimed feelingly,
tears starting to her eyes as memory brought
vividly before her the sad scenes connected
with the loss of his right hand, "he is welcome
to the use of any or all of my books. I will
gladly do anything in my power to help
him."</p>

<p>"Now, suppose we talk about ourselves and
our own affairs," Zillah suggested in her
sprightly way. "I'm extremely anxious to
learn to play on that lovely piano, but don't
see how either you, mother, or Milly is to find
time to give me lessons, for you are both busy
as bees now from morning to night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I want to learn too," put in Ada imploringly.</p>

<p>"So you shall, dears, both of you, if you
continue to be the good, industrious, helpful
girls you have been for the past year," the
mother said, with her cheery smile. "Milly
and I will manage it between us. Almost all
our winter clothes are made now, so that we
will not need to give so much time to sewing
as we have for the past month or more."</p>

<p>Mildred seemed to be thinking. "I believe
we can manage it," she said presently. "I
hear the recitations from nine to eleven now,
you know; we must begin at eight after this,
and then from ten to twelve can be spared for
the two music lessons."</p>

<p>"And the afternoons and evenings you must
reserve for yourself&mdash;your exercise, study,
reading and recreation," added Mrs. Keith,
"while I oversee the practicing and the preparation
of lessons for the next day. Two
music lessons a week to each will be all sufficient.
Yes, I am sure that with system and
rigid economy of time&mdash;making good use of
each golden minute as it flies&mdash;we can accomplish
all that is necessary, if not all that is desirable."</p>

<p>Again a few moments of thoughtful silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
on Mildred's part, then, "Mother," she said,
"do you think I ought to take that Sunday-school
class? I don't feel fit, and&mdash;and besides,
it will take a good deal of my time to
attend right to it&mdash;prepare the lessons, and occasionally
visit the children through the week."</p>

<p>"I would have you consider the question
carefully and prayerfully, and in the light of
God's holy word, which is our only rule of
faith and practice, daughter. 'As we have
therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all
men.' 'He that winneth souls is wise.'"</p>

<p>"But, mother, I am not wise."</p>

<p>Mildred's tone was low and humble.</p>

<p>"'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of
God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth
not; and it shall be given him.' Ask
for it and search the Scriptures for it, for we
are told, 'The entrance of thy word giveth
light; it giveth understanding to the simple.'
And while you study it for the benefit of
others, you will be cultivating your own soul&mdash;a
matter of even greater importance than
the culture of your intellect."</p>

<p>"And I could not do the first without at the
same time doing the last."</p>

<p>"No; that is very true. Also I trust,
daughter, that your great motive for improving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
your mental powers is that you may thus
be prepared to do better service to the Master?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, mother; it is, if I know my own
heart," Mildred said, looking up with shining
eyes. "I know it is said that duties never
conflict, yet it does seem sometimes as though
they did."</p>

<p>"As, for example?" and her mother's eyes
smiled encouragingly and sympathizingly into
hers.</p>

<p>"Why, there is the weekly church prayer-meeting
to take one whole evening out of the
six."</p>

<p>"Only from an hour to an hour and a half,"
corrected Mrs. Keith.</p>

<p>"But it breaks into the evening so that one
can hardly do much with the leavings," Mildred
said with a slight laugh. "And then the
young girls' prayer-meeting breaks up one
afternoon of every week, and besides&mdash;O
mother! it is a real trial to me to lead in
prayer, and I am sure to be called on."</p>

<p>"I hope you will never refuse," Mrs. Keith
said gently, and with a tender, loving look.
"We should never fear to attempt any duty,
looking to God for help, for it shall be given,
and a blessing with it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a great cross to me."</p>

<p>"Greater than that the Master bore for
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, no! nothing to compare to it, or
even to what many a martyr and many a missionary
has done and borne for him."</p>

<p>"And is it not a blessed privilege to be permitted
to do and bear something for his dear
sake?" Mrs. Keith asked with glistening eyes,
and in tones trembling with emotion.</p>

<p>"O mother, yes!" And Mildred's head
bowed low, a tear fell on her work.</p>

<p>"O my darling, be a whole-hearted Christian!"
the mother went on, speaking with intense
earnestness, "consecrate yourself and all
you have to the Master's service&mdash;time, talents,
influence, money&mdash;everything you possess. He
gave himself for us; shall we hold back anything
from him?"</p>

<p>"Oh no! But mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, dear?"</p>

<p>"Shall I not do better service by and by,
perhaps, by now giving my whole time, energy,
and thought to preparation for it?"</p>

<p>"Do you find that you can always do a given
amount of mental work in a given space of
time?"</p>

<p>"No, mother; sometimes my brain is so active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
that I can do more in an hour than at
some other times I can accomplish in a
day."</p>

<p>"And cannot He who made you, and gave
you all your mental powers, cause them at any
time to be thus active? My child, he never
lets us lose by working for him; in some way
he will more than make it good to us. 'He
that watereth shall be watered also himself.'
'Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His
righteousness; and all these things shall be
added unto you.'"</p>

<p>Mildred looked up brightly. "I think&mdash;I
am sure you are right, mother; and I will take
up all those duties, trusting to the dear Master
to help me with them and with my studies.
My time is his as well as all else that I have."</p>

<p>"'Yes, ye are not your own, for ye are
bought with a price; therefore glorify God
in your body and in your spirit, which are
God's.'"</p>

<p>"Who, mother?" asked little Fan, playing
with her doll near by.</p>

<p>"All God's children, my child."</p>

<p>"I want to be one, mother. But who bought
them? and what with? what price?"</p>

<p>"Christ bought them, dear, with his own
precious blood."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother," said Ada softly, "how good he
was! I wish I could do something for him;
but I'm not old enough to teach in Sunday-school,
or pray in the prayer-meeting."</p>

<p>"No, darling; but you can pray at home,
kneeling alone in your own room, and join with
your heart in the prayers at family worship
and at church; you can pray in your heart at
any time and in any place; for yourself and
for others. In his great kindness and condescension
God listens to our prayers at all times,
if they come from the heart, and just as readily
to those of a little child as to those of the
wisest and mightiest of men."</p>

<p>"O mother, I'm glad of that! but if I could
do some work for him I'd love to do it."</p>

<p>"Do you remember, dear, that once when
Jesus was on earth the people asked him
'What shall we do that we might work the
works of God?' and Jesus answered and said
unto them, 'This is the work of God, that ye
believe on him whom he hath sent.'"</p>

<p>"That was Jesus himself," the child said
thoughtfully, staying her needle in mid air,
while her eyes sought the floor. "Mother,
could you tell me <em>just</em> what is meant by believing
on him so as to be saved? It can't
mean only believing all the Bible says about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
him is true, because it tells us 'the devils also
believe, and tremble.' I heard father read it
from the Bible at worship this morning."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear child, it does mean much
more than that," the mother said, and silently
asked help of God to make it clear to the apprehension
of all present, even to little Annis,
who leant confidingly against her knee, the
blue eyes gazing earnestly into her face.</p>

<p>"The devils know the truth, but they don't
love it," she said; "God's children do: they
are glad that he reigns and rules in all the universe;
but the devils gnash their teeth with
rage that it is so, and would tear him from his
throne if they could."</p>

<p>The two little boys were in the room, Cyril
whittling, Don poring over a new book that
Mildred had brought him from Philadelphia.
The one shut his jack-knife, the other his book,
and both drew near to listen.</p>

<p>"Jesus didn't die for them, did he, mother?"
asked Cyril.</p>

<p>"No, my son, there is no salvation offered
them, and God might justly have left us in
the same awful condition; but of his great
love and mercy he has provided a wonderful
way by which we can be saved. 'For God so
loved the world that he gave his only begotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish, but have everlasting life.'</p>

<p>"Faith is another word that means the same
as believing. The Bible tells us that without
faith it is impossible to please God; also, that
the faith which availeth anything worketh by
love. 'Unto you, therefore, which believe, he
(that is, Jesus) is precious.' The faith that
pleases God and will save from sin and eternal
death, loves the Lord Jesus Christ, and trusts
for salvation only in what he has done and
suffered for us."</p>

<p>"We can't do anything to save ourselves,
mother?"</p>

<p>"We can not do anything to earn our salvation;
we can have it only as God's free, undeserved
gift. We have all broken God's holy
law, but Jesus kept it perfectly in our stead.
Our sins deserve God's wrath and curse, both
in this life and that which is to come, for it is
written, 'Cursed is every one who continueth
not in all things which are written in the book
of the law to do them;' but Jesus has borne
that curse for all his people. 'Christ hath redeemed
us from the curse of the law, being
made a curse for us.'"</p>

<p>"I should like to have that right kind of
faith if I knew just how to get it, mother," said
Ada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"'By grace are ye saved, through faith;
and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of
God,'" quoted Mrs. Keith. "Ask for it, my
child. Jesus said, 'Every one that asketh, receiveth;'
and again, 'If ye shall ask anything
in my name I will do it.'"</p>

<p>"You know, my child, that though we cannot
see him, he is always near. Go to him in
prayer, confess your sins, tell him that you are
altogether sinful by nature and by practice,
and can do nothing at all to deserve his favor;
but that you come in his name, and pleading
what he has done and suffered for you, because
he has invited you so to come. Ask him to
take away your wicked heart and give you a
new one full of love to him; accept his offered
salvation from sin and hell; give yourself to
him and he will take you for his own; for he
says, 'Him that cometh to me I will in no wise
cast out.' He will give you true faith and
true repentance&mdash;sorrow for sin because it is
displeasing to God; a sorrow that will lead
you to hate and forsake it, and to be a follower
of God as a dear child, doing him service from
the heart, striving to please, honor, and glorify
him in all things; not that you may be saved,
but because you are saved."</p>

<p>"But what can a little girl like me <em>do</em> for
him, mother?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or a boy like me or Cyril?" added Don.</p>

<p>"Christ is our example, and one thing the
Bible tells us of him is that when he was a
child on earth he was subject to his parents;
that is, he obeyed and honored them. You
must do the same by yours, if you would be
his disciples. There are few, comparatively,
whom God calls to do what men consider great
things for him, but if we do faithfully each
little every-day duty&mdash;it may be only to learn
a lesson, to sweep or dust a room, to make a
bed, go on an errand, or something else quite
as simple and easy&mdash;because we want to please
and honor him; he will accept it as work
done for him. Men can judge only from appearances&mdash;God
sees the heart, the motives;
and according as they are good or bad is he
pleased or displeased with our acts."</p>

<p>"Mother," cried Ada, looking up with a
glad smile, "how nice that is! Any work must
be sweet when we think of God watching and
being pleased with us for doing it just as well
as we can because we love him."</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter, love is a great sweetener of
labor of whatever kind it may be."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith and Wallace Ormsby were busy,
each at his own desk; unbroken silence had
reigned in the office for the last half hour,
when suddenly dropping his pen and wheeling
about in his chair, the elder gentleman
addressed the younger:</p>

<p>"Why, how's this, Wallace? I haven't seen
you in my house or heard of your being there
for weeks; what's wrong?"</p>

<p>Wallace, taken by surprise, could only stammer
out rather incoherently something about
having had a good deal to do&mdash;"correspondence
and other writing, studying up that case,
you know, sir."</p>

<p>"Come, come, now, you're not so hard
pushed with work that you can't take a little
recreation now and then," returned his interrogator
kindly; "and really I don't think you
can find a much better place for that than my
house; especially since Mildred's at home
again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is very true, sir," said Wallace, "but&mdash;I'd
be extremely sorry to wear out my welcome,"
he added, with a laugh that seemed a
trifle forced.</p>

<p>"No fear of that, Wallace; not the slightest,"
Mr. Keith answered heartily: "why, we
consider you quite one of the family; we can
never forget how kindly you nursed us in that
sickly season. And we've a new attraction."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, so I heard. A very fine instrument,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if we are judges. Come up this
evening and hear Mildred play. I think she
has really a genius for music; but that may be
a fond father's partiality."</p>

<p>The invitation was too tempting to be declined:
it had taken a very strong effort of will
to enable the love-sick swain to stay so long
away from his heart's idol, and now under her
father's hospitable urgency his resolution gave
way.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir; I shall be delighted to
come: and I have no doubt Miss Mildred is
quite as fine a performer as you think her," he
said; and each resumed his pen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith, with strong faith in the wisdom
of the old adage, "All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy," always insisted upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
each member of her household taking a due
amount of recreation. The older girls would
sometimes, in their eagerness to finish a piece
of work or learn a lesson for the morrow, be
ready to take up book or sewing immediately
on leaving the tea-table; but their mother put
a veto upon that, and by precept and example
encouraged a half hour of social chat, romping
with the little ones, or gathering about the
piano to listen to Mildred's playing: and often
a little time before tea was given to music both
vocal and instrumental, every one, even down
to little Annis, frequently taking part in the
latter.</p>

<p>This season of mirth and jollity was over for
the evening, Mrs. Keith had taken the younger
children away to put them to bed, Zillah and
Ada were at their tasks in the sitting-room;
but Mildred still lingered at the piano, feeling
that she had need of practice to recover lost
ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith listened a little longer, then remarking
that he must see Squire Chetwood
about a business matter, donned hat and overcoat
and went out.</p>

<p>Rupert stood beside his sister, turning the
pages of her music and praising her execution.
"I'd like all the town to hear you," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
"I should prefer a much smaller audience,"
she returned, laughingly. "Ru, did you remember
to mail that letter?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't!" he cried, in some consternation.</p>

<p>She drew out her pretty watch.</p>

<p>"There's time yet," he said, glancing at its
face; "so I'm off."</p>

<p>Hurrying out of the front door, he encountered
Ormsby in the porch.</p>

<p>"Hollo! is that you, Wallace?" he cried.
"A little more and there'd have been a collision.
Haven't seen you here for an age! been
wondering what had become of you. Well,
walk right in. You'll find Milly in the parlor.
But you must excuse me for awhile as I've a
letter to mail."</p>

<p>He held the door open as he spoke, and having
seen the caller inside, hastily shut it without
waiting for a reply to his remarks, and
rushed away.</p>

<p>The parlor door stood ajar. Wallace tapped
lightly; but Mildred, intent upon her music,
did not hear, and he stole quietly in. He stood
for a moment almost entranced by the low
sweet tones of voice and instrument.</p>

<p>Mildred was thinking of Charlie, and her
voice was full of pathos as she sang&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'When we two parted<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In silence and tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half broken-hearted,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To sever for years.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A deep sigh startled her and she turned
hastily to find&mdash;not Charlie, but Wallace regarding
her with eyes full of despairing love
mingled with tender compassion.</p>

<p>He saw that her eyes were full of tears, and
coming quickly to her side took her hand in
his.</p>

<p>"Dear Mildred, I can't bear to see you unhappy,"
he said, in low, tremulous tones.
"Don't grieve, it will all come right some day.
Ah, if only I could have won your heart!" and
again he sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"It's the old story, 'the course of true love
never will run smooth,' and we can only be
sorry for each other," she returned with forced
gayety, and hastily wiping away her tears.
"Take a seat, won't you, and I'll give you
something more cheerful than that sickly sentimental
stuff you caught me singing. That
is, of course, if you wish to hear it;" and she
looked up into his face with an arch smile.</p>

<p>A tete-a-tete with him at that time was not
desirable&mdash;would be rather embarrassing; she
wanted to avoid it, and heartily wished some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
one of the family would come in immediately;
therefore was not seriously displeased at the
sudden and unexpected entrance of Celestia
Ann.</p>

<p>This very independent maid-of-all-work
came bustling in, dressed in her "Sunday
best" and with a bit of sewing in her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-evenin', Mr. Ormsby," she said, nodding
to him; then turning to Mildred: "I
declare, Miss Mildred, your playin' is so powerful
fine I couldn't noways stand it to set out
there in the kitchen while the pianner was a
goin' in here and nobody to listen to it. You
see I thought you were alone; but I reckon
Mr. Ormsby won't mind me."</p>

<p>Wallace was too well aware of the value of
the woman's services and the difficulty of retaining
them to make any objection. He merely nodded
and smiled in reply to her salutation; then
turning to Mildred answered her with, "Indeed
I should be delighted. In fact your father invited
me to call this evening for the express
purpose of listening to your music, and," he
added in a whisper, "though I feared my visit
might not be altogether welcome to you, I had
not the courage to deny myself so great a
pleasure."</p>

<p>"There was no occasion," Mildred said, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the same low tone: "we all want you to feel
yourself quite at home here. You'll excuse the
intrusion of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly: I understand it."</p>

<p>Celestia Ann had seated herself beside a
lamp burning on a distant table, and was industriously
plying her needle.</p>

<p>"Come, give us a lively toon, Miss Milly,
won't ye?" she said. "'Yankee Doodle,' or
'Hail Colomby,' or some o' them toons folks
dances to."</p>

<p>"Which or what will you have, Mr. Ormsby?"
asked Mildred.</p>

<p>"I?" he said, with a smile; "oh, I own to
sharing Miss Hunsinger's partiality for our national
airs, and am well satisfied with the selections
already made."</p>

<p>Mildred gave them in succession.</p>

<p>A tall man with a book under his arm stood
in a listening attitude at the gate. Mrs. Keith,
seeing him from an upper window, came down
and opened the front door.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Lightcap," she said in
her pleasant voice, "won't you come in out of
the cold?"</p>

<p>"I come to fetch back your book, Mrs.
Keith," he said, moving toward her with long
strides, "and I thought I'd not disturb the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
folks in your parlor by knockin' whilst that
music was agoin'. I'm a thousand times
obleeged fer the loan o' the book, ma'am;" and
he handed it to her, then lifted his cap as if in
adieu.</p>

<p>"No, no; don't go yet," she said. "I have
another book for you, and you must have some
more of the music, if you care to hear it,
without standing in the cold to listen."</p>

<p>Her pleasant cordiality put him at his ease,
and he followed her into the parlor.</p>

<p>Mildred was playing and singing "Star Spangled
Banner," Wallace accompanying her with
his voice, both so taken up with the business in
hand that they did not perceive the entrance
of Mrs. Keith and Gotobed until they joined
in on the chorus; when Mildred looked up in
surprise and nodded a smiling welcome to the
latter.</p>

<p>"Tell you, that's grand!" he exclaimed at
the close, his face lighting up with patriotic enthusiasm;
"there's somethin' mighty inspirin'
about them national airs o' ourn. Don't ye
think so, Mrs. Keith?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "they always stir my blood
with love for my dear native land, and awaken
emotions of gratitude to God and those gallant
forefathers who fought and bled to secure her
liberties."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" he sighed with a downward glance
at his mutilated arm, "I can never lift sword
or gun for her if occasion should come again!"</p>

<p>"But you may do as much, or even more, in
other ways," she responded cheerily.</p>

<p>"I can't see how, ma'am," he returned, with
a rueful shake of the head.</p>

<p>"'Knowledge is power;' intellect can often
accomplish more than brute force: go on cultivating
your mind and storing up information,
and opportunities for usefulness will be given
you in due time," she answered with her bright,
sweet smile; then turned with a cordial greeting
to Lu Grange and Claudina and Will Chetwood,
ushered in at that moment by Celestia
Ann, who now took her departure to the kitchen&mdash;probably
thinking Miss Mildred had
listeners enough to be able to spare her.</p>

<p>The piano was a new and powerful attraction
to the good people of Pleasant Plains,
and all the friends and acquaintance of the
Keiths, as well as some whose title to either
appellation was doubtful, flocked to hear it in
such numbers that for two or three weeks after
its arrival Mildred seemed to be holding a levee
almost every evening.</p>

<p>"How my time is being wasted!" she sighed
one evening as the door closed upon the last
departing guest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, dear, I think not," responded her
mother, with an affectionate look and a kindly
reassuring smile; "you are recovering lost
ground&mdash;perfecting yourself in facility of execution,
and giving a great deal of pleasure;
and it is no small privilege to be permitted to
do that last&mdash;to cheer heavy hearts, to lift burdens,
to make life even a little brighter to some
of our fellow creatures. Is not that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, it is, and yet I find it very
trying to have my plans so often interfered
with."</p>

<p>"Ah! my child, we must not allow ourselves
to become too much attached to our plans,"
returned Mrs. Keith, with a slightly humorous
look and tone, and passing her hand caressingly
over Mildred's hair; "for all through life
we shall be very frequently compelled by circumstances
to set them aside."</p>

<p>"Is there any use in making plans, then?" the
girl asked half impatiently.</p>

<p>"Surely there is. If we would accomplish anything
worth while, we must lay our plans carefully,
thoughtfully, wisely; then carry them
out with all energy and perseverance: yet not
allow ourselves to be impatient and unhappy
when providentially called upon to set them
aside. 'It is not in man that walketh to direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
his steps;' and we ought to be not only willing
to bend to God's providence, but glad to have
him choose for us."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, mother&mdash;yes indeed!" Mildred
murmured, a dewy light coming into her eyes;
"if one could only always realize that he sends
or permits these little trials they wouldn't be
hard to bear; for it is sweet to have him choose
for us."</p>

<p>It so happened that this was the last of that
trial of Mildred's patience. A storm set in
that night which lasted for several days, keeping
almost everybody at home; then came
weeks of ice and snow, making fine sleighing,
skating, and sliding; thus furnishing other and
more exciting amusement to the residents of
the town, both old and young.</p>

<p>The Keiths took their share in these winter
pastimes&mdash;Mildred as well as the rest: often
doing so to please her mother rather than herself,
yet always finding enjoyment in them.</p>

<p>'Twas a busy life she led that winter, and by
no means an unhappy one, spite of the obstinate
refusal of the course of true love to run smooth.</p>

<p>It came to a rougher place, to deeper, swifter
rapids, in the ensuing spring.</p>

<p>Through all these months of separation she
and Charlie had kept up a correspondence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
though at somewhat irregular and infrequent
intervals. A much longer time than usual had
now passed, and yet her last letter to him remained
unanswered. She was secretly very
much disturbed in mind, sorely troubled lest
some evil had befallen him, though not permitting
herself to doubt for a moment that his
love for her remained as strong and fervent as
ever.</p>

<p>At last a letter came. Rupert brought it
from the office at noon, and handed it to her
with a meaning smile, a twinkle of fun in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Something to brighten this dull, rainy day
for you, sis," he said gayly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she returned, flushing rosy
red, and her heart giving a joyous bound as she
slipped the missive into her pocket.</p>

<p>"What! not going to read it after the long
journey it has taken to reach you?" he asked,
lifting his eyebrows in mock astonishment.</p>

<p>"Not now, it will keep; and I must get
mother's toast and tea ready for her&mdash;there'll
be barely time before father comes in to dinner."</p>

<p>"How is she?"</p>

<p>"Better, but not able to be up yet. These
bad headaches always leave her weak, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
shall try to persuade her to lie still all the
afternoon."</p>

<p>With the last word Mildred hurried away
to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The morning had been a very trying one:
it was Monday, the day of the week on which
Celestia Ann always insisted upon doing the
family washing without regard to the state of
the weather. She prided herself on getting
her clothes out early and having them white
as the driven snow, and her temper was never
proof against the trial of a Monday-morning
storm.</p>

<p>There had been a steady pour of rain since
before daybreak, and the queen of the kitchen
consequently in anything but an amiable mood.
A severe headache had kept Mrs. Keith in bed,
and to Mildred had fallen the task of guiding
and controlling the domestic machinery and
seeing that its wheels ran smoothly.</p>

<p>She had had several disputes to settle between
Ada and Zillah on the one side, and the
irate maid-of-all-work on the other; also much
ado to induce the younger children to attend to
their lessons, and then to keep them amused
and quiet that her mother might not be disturbed
by their noise, and through it all her
heart was heavy with its own peculiar burden;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
besides, atmospheric influences had their depressing
effect upon her spirits, as upon those
of the others, and more than once a sharp or
impatient word, repented of as soon as uttered,
had escaped her lips.</p>

<p>"An undeserved blessing," was her remorseful
thought at sight of the letter. "It may be
ill news to be sure&mdash;oh if it should!&mdash;yet anything
is better than this terrible suspense."</p>

<p>But that must be borne until she could
snatch a moment of solitude in which to end
it.</p>

<p>Zillah, stooping over the kitchen fire, looked
up hastily as her sister entered. "You've
come to get mother's dinner, Milly? Well,
here it is all ready," pointing to the teapot
steaming on the hearth, beside it a plate of
nicely browned and buttered toast.</p>

<p>"O you dear good girls!" was Mildred's
response as she glanced from the stove to the
table, upon which Ada was in the act of placing
a neatly arranged tea tray.</p>

<p>"As if it wasn't the greatest pleasure in the
world to do a little for mother!" exclaimed
the latter half indignantly. "You needn't
think, Milly, that the rest of us don't love her
just as well as you do."</p>

<p>"I meant no such insinuation," Mildred said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
half laughing. "I'm sure our mother deserves
the greatest possible amount of love and devotion
from all her children. But may I claim
the privilege of carrying up the dinner you
two have prepared?"</p>

<p>"Yes: I suppose it's no more than fair to let
you do that much; but you needn't expect me
to think it's any great goodness," Ada answered,
putting the finishing touches to her work, and
stepping aside to let Mildred take possession
of the tray.</p>

<p>"Certainly nothing is farther from my
thoughts than claiming credit for any service
done to mother," Mildred answered good-humoredly
as she took up the tray and walked
away with it.</p>

<p>With quick light step she passed up the
stairs, and entering her mother's room with almost
noiseless tread, was greeted with a smile.</p>

<p>"I am not asleep, dear; and the pain is
nearly gone," Mrs. Keith said, speaking from
the bed in low, quiet tones.</p>

<p>"I am so glad, mother, and I hope a cup of
tea will complete the cure," Mildred answered
softly, setting down her burden on a little
stand by the bedside and gently assisting her
mother to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>"A dainty little meal! My dear child, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
are the greatest possible comfort to me!" Mrs.
Keith remarked presently, as she handed back
the empty cup.</p>

<p>"But it was Zillah and Ada who prepared
it to-day, mother," Mildred returned, ever careful
to give others their just due, though her
eyes shone.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are dear girls too," the mother
said; "I am greatly blessed in my children:
but I was thinking more of the freedom from
care given me by having you here to take the
head of affairs. The others, though doubtless
equally willing, are still too young for that.
So I could never give myself up to the full
enjoyment of a headache while you were away,"
she added in her own peculiarly pleasant, sportive
tone and manner.</p>

<p>"I cannot half fill your place, mother dear;
I have not half your wisdom or patience," Mildred
said with a blush and sigh.</p>

<p>"You exaggerate my virtues, Milly; I can
imagine from past experience how your
patience may have been tried to-day. Well,
dear, if there has been a partial failure, do not
let that rob you of your peace. 'Like as a
father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth
them that fear him;' and though he cannot look
upon sin with any degree of allowance, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
when we turn from it with true repentance
and desire after holiness, pleading the merits
of his dear Son as our only ground of acceptance,
we find him ever ready to forgive.
What a blessing, what a glorious privilege it
is that we have, in that we may turn in heart
to him for pardon and cleansing the moment
we are conscious of sin in thought, word, or
deed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; I do feel it so. And how
strangely kind he often is in sending joys and
comforts when we feel that we deserve punishments
rather," Mildred said with tears
springing to her eyes, as she drew out her letter
and held it up.</p>

<p>"From Charlie!" Mrs. Keith exclaimed,
with a pleased smile. "My darling, I am very
glad for you. I hope it brings good news."</p>

<p>Mildred turned it in a way to show that the
seal was not yet broken, answering in low,
tremulous tones, and between a smile and a
sigh, "I have not found out yet. It must
wait for a quiet after-dinner half-hour."</p>

<p>"My brave, patient girl!" Mrs. Keith said
tenderly, passing a hand caressingly over Mildred's
hair and cheek. "Let mother share the
joy or sorrow, whichever it brings."</p>

<p>Mildred brought but scant appetite to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
meal, which seemed to her an unusually long
and tedious one; but she was able to control
her impatience and give due attention to the
comfort of father, brothers and sisters, until at
length she found herself at liberty to retire for
a season to the privacy of her own room.</p>

<p>Her hand trembled and her heart beat fast
between hope and fear as she drew the letter
from her pocket and broke the seal. What if
it brought ill news&mdash;that Charlie was in trouble,
or that his love had grown cold! Had she
strength to bear it?</p>

<p>Oh, not of herself! But there was One who
had said, "In me is thine help." "Fear thou
not, for I am <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wtih'">with</ins> thee; be not dismayed; for
I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I
will help thee."</p>

<p>One moment's silent pleading of His gracious
promises, and she had grown calm and
strong to endure whatever His providence had
sent. Tears dropped upon the paper as she
read, for Charlie was indeed in sore trouble.
The first few sentences read as though the
writer were half frenzied with distress.</p>

<p>"He had lost everything," so he wrote;
"both his own and his uncle's property had
been suddenly and completely swept away, and
the shock had killed the old gentleman&mdash;his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
only near relative&mdash;leaving him friendless and
alone in the world; utterly alone, utterly
friendless; for he could not hope that she who
had refused him in prosperity would be willing
to share his poverty. Nor could he ask it.
But never, never could he forget her, never
love another."</p>

<p>Then under a later date, and in apparently
calmer mood, he continued:</p>

<p>"I am about to leave the home of my childhood
and youth; it passes to-day into the hands
of strangers, and I go out into the wide world
to seek some way of retrieving my broken fortunes.
With youth, health and strength, and
a liberal education, surely I need not despair
of finally attaining that end, though it will
doubtless take years of toil and struggle; but
when it is accomplished you shall hear from
me again: nay, you shall find me at your feet,
suing for the priceless boon I have hitherto
sought in vain. I will not despair, for my
heart tells me you will be true to me even
through many long years of separation&mdash;if such
fate has decreed us&mdash;and that in answer to your
prayers the barrier between us will one day be
swept away."</p>

<p>"Share his poverty! Ah, would I not if I
might!" Mildred cried half aloud and with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
burst of tears. "What greater boon could I
ask than the privilege of comforting him in his
sorrows! O Charlie, Charlie, you have given
no address, and so put it out of my power to
offer even the poor consolation of written
words of sympathy, of hope and cheer!"</p>

<p>No one came to disturb Mildred in her
solitude; she had time for thought and for the
casting of her care upon Him who was her
strong refuge, whereunto she might continually
resort.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith had not left her own room, and
downstairs the two elder girls were busied
with their needles, while Rupert kept the
younger children quiet with kite-making and
a story, moved thereto partly by a good-natured
desire for their amusement, but principally
through affectionate concern for mother
and elder sister.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith lay on her couch, thinking, a
little anxiously, of Mildred, when the door
opened and the young girl stole softly to her
side.</p>

<p>"Is it ill news, my darling?" the mother
asked in tender, pitying accents, glancing up
compassionately at the dewy eyes and tear
stained cheeks.</p>

<p>"I will read you his letter, mother. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
know I have no secrets from you, my loved
and only confidante," Mildred answered a little
tremulously, and stooping to press a kiss on
her mother's lips.</p>

<p>Then seating herself, she unfolded the sheet
and read in low tones, which she vainly tried
to make calm and even.</p>

<p>"Ah, mother, if only he were a Christian!"
she exclaimed with a burst of uncontrollable
weeping.</p>

<p>"Do not despair of seeing him such one
day," her mother returned, laying a gentle,
quieting hand on that of the weeper. "God
is the hearer and answerer of prayer; the answer
may be long delayed, for the trial of your
faith, but it will come at last."</p>

<p>"What is Charlie waiting for?" sighed Mildred.
"How strange that he cannot see that
God's time for the sinner to come and be reconciled
to him is always now! Ah, I do so
want him to know the comfort of casting all his
care on the Lord&mdash;the blessedness of the man
who trusts in him!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a strange delusion! It is one of
Satan's devices to persuade men to put off this
most important of all transactions to a more
convenient season, which he knows will never
come. But, dear child, we will unite our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
prayers on Charlie's behalf to Him who has all
power in heaven and in earth, and who has
graciously promised, 'If two of you shall agree
on earth as touching anything that they shall
ask, it shall be done for them of my Father
which is in heaven.'"</p>

<p>"Mother, he seems to imply that I am not
likely to hear from him again for years," Mildred
remarked, half in assertion, half as asking
her mother's understanding of the drift of
young Landreth's communication.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," Mrs. Keith responded in
gentle, pitying tones. Then more brightly and
cheerily, "But perhaps, dear, that certainty is
better&mdash;will be less trying&mdash;than a constantly
disappointed looking for of letters."</p>

<p>Mildred gave a silent assent, while a tear
rolled quickly down her cheek. She dashed it
hastily aside. "Mother, dearest mother, you
must help me to be brave and cheerful, not
letting this disappointment and anxiety spoil
my life and make me a burden to myself and
others," she whispered tremulously, laying her
head on her mother's pillow and gazing lovingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
but through gathering tears, into those
dear eyes.</p>

<p>"I will, my poor darling," returned Mrs.
Keith in moved tones, putting an arm about
her daughter's neck and drawing her closer
till cheek rested against cheek; "and there is
One who, with all power at his command, and
loving you even more tenderly than your mother
does, will give you such help and consolation
in this sore trial as she cannot give."</p>

<p>"I know it; I am sure of it," murmured
Mildred. "I can trust him for myself&mdash;though
the way looks dark and dreary&mdash;but&mdash;O
mother, it is not so easy to trust for Charlie!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, dear, that is one reason why this
trial is sent you: trust for our dear ones as
well as for ourselves is a lesson we all need to
learn."</p>

<p>"And to teach me patience, which is another
lesson I greatly need and am very slow to
learn," sighed Mildred. "'The trying of your
faith worketh patience. But let patience have
her perfect work.' Oh, shall I ever be able to
do that!"</p>

<p>"Yes, at last; I am assured of it: 'being
confident of this very thing, that he who hath
begun a good work in you will perform it until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the day of Jesus Christ.' 'In all these
things we are more than conquerors through
him that loved us.' And trusting in him,
living near to him, in the light of his countenance,
we <em>may</em> have, we <em>shall</em> have great joy
and peace in spite of tribulations."</p>

<p>"And those I know all must have in one
way or another," said Mildred a little sadly,
"because we are told in Acts, 'we must through
much tribulation enter into the kingdom of
God;' and Jesus told his disciples, 'In the
world ye shall have tribulation.'"</p>

<p>"But, he added, 'Be of good cheer: I have
overcome the world,'" Mrs. Keith said with
emotion, a joyous light shining in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Mildred, "I once heard the
assertion that God's people were peculiarly
marked out for trouble and trial in this world;
that they must expect to have more than was
allotted to worldlings. Do you think that is
true?"</p>

<p>"No, I find no such teaching in Scripture,
nor has experience of life taught it to me.
'Many sorrows shall be to the wicked, but he
that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass
him about.' 'Many are the afflictions of the
righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of
them all.' 'O fear the Lord, ye his saints,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
for there is no want to them that fear him!'
'Godliness is profitable unto all things, having
promise of the life that now is, and of that
which is to come.' The Bible is full of the
blessedness of those who fear and trust the
Lord."</p>

<p>"'Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,
and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth,'"
quoted Mildred doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; the afflictions of the righteous are
the loving discipline of a tender Father, while
upon the incorrigibly wicked he pours out his
fury in judgments that bring no healing to
their souls&mdash;only retribution for the sins unrepented
of and unforgiven. 'Upon the wicked
he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an
horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of
their cup.'"</p>

<p>The door opened softly and Ada looked cautiously
in.</p>

<p>"That is right, dear," Mrs. Keith said, greeting
the child with a loving smile; "come in
and give mother a kiss. The pain is quite gone,
and I am going to get up now and dress for tea."</p>

<p>"Don't, mother, unless you feel quite, <em>quite</em>
strong and well," the little girl entreated, receiving
and returning a tender caress. "I'm
so glad you are better (oh, it isn't nice to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
to do without mother! though I'm sure Milly
has tried her very best to fill your place). I
wouldn't have come here&mdash;because I was afraid
of disturbing you&mdash;but there's a boy down
stairs asking if Milly will go and watch to-night
with a sick woman&mdash;Mrs. Martin. Claudina
Chetwood's to watch, but there ought to be
two, he says, and they don't know of anybody
else for to-night. She's been sick so long that
'most everybody is worn out."</p>

<p>Professional nurses were unknown in the
town, and in time of sickness the only dependence
for needed attention, outside of the sufferer's
own family, was upon the kindness of
neighbors, and as a rule they were exceeding
kind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martin's health had been declining for
many months; for weeks she had been confined
to bed and in a condition to need constant
watching and waiting upon.</p>

<p>The Keiths had scarcely a speaking acquaintance
with her, but that made no difference
when help was needed.</p>

<p>"Do you feel equal to the task, Mildred?"
asked her mother. "I shall be sorry to have
you lose your night's rest; but you can make
it up to-morrow. I am not likely to have a
return of the headache, and when I am 'to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
fore' you can be spared, you know," she added
sportively, and with a world of motherly pride
and affection in the look she bent upon her
first-born.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; it will not hurt me, and I can't
hesitate when duty seems so plain," Mildred
answered cheerfully. "How soon do they
want me, Ada?"</p>

<p>"He says about nine o'clock. Mrs. Prior's
going to stay till then. I'll go down and tell
him they may expect you;" and with the last
word Ada left the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith had left the bed for a low seat
before her toilet table, and Mildred was softly
brushing out and arranging her still beautiful
and abundant hair, very tenderly careful lest
too rude a touch should cause a return of the
torturing pain.</p>

<p>"Poor, poor woman!" sighed Mrs. Keith,
thinking of Mrs. Martin.</p>

<p>"Is she considered very dangerously ill, mother?"
asked Mildred.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Prior was telling me about her yesterday,"
Mrs. Keith answered. "Dr. Grange
says she has not long to live; but worst of
all, Milly, she is dying without hope."</p>

<p>"O mother, how terrible! And has no one
tried to lead her to Jesus? has no one told her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
of his great love and his power and willingness
to save?'"</p>

<p>"Yes, months ago, while she was still up
and about her house, Mrs. Prior and others tried
to talk to her about her soul's salvation, but
she refused to listen, angrily telling them she
was too weak to trouble herself with trying to
think on that subject now, and must wait until
she grew stronger; and all the time growing
weaker and weaker. My child, I'm glad you
are to be with her to-night, for who knows but
you may find a fitting moment in which you
may speak a word that God may bless to the
saving of her soul."</p>

<p>"How glad I should be to do it," Mildred
answered with emotion, "but I am so young
and foolish and ignorant! Mother, how can I
hope to succeed where older and wiser people
have failed?"</p>

<p>"'Not by might, nor by power, but by my
Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.' He often works
by the feeblest instrumentalities, and may see
fit to use even you, my dear girl. Ask his
help and his blessing upon your effort, remembering
his promise, 'If any of you lack wisdom,
let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be
given him.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will watch for an opportunity, and you
will help me with your prayers, mother?"</p>

<p>"You may be sure of that, dear child."</p>

<p>"But, O mother! how very much better you
could speak to her than I."</p>

<p>"I doubt it, Milly; for the work must be of
God, or it will come to naught; and he can as
readily make use of your mind and tongue as
of mine. Don't rely on yourself; don't forget
that you are only an instrument."</p>

<p>In spite of a very honest and earnest determination
to be cheerful under this new trial of
her faith and patience, and to bear her own
burden according to the scriptural command,
Mildred seemed to her father a little sad-eyed
and paler than her wont, as he looked at her
across the tea table.</p>

<p>"My child," he said, "I hear you are expecting
to watch with the sick to-night, but
really I'm afraid you are not able to do so;
you do not look well."</p>

<p>"Appearances are sometimes deceitful, you
know, father," she returned, with an effort to
be bright and lively. "I am quite well, and
if fatigued to-night can rest and sleep to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, only half convinced, "lie
down until it is time for you to go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Mildred, if you can get an hour or
two of sleep before your watch begins, it will
be a great help," said her mother. "We will
call you at nine."</p>

<p>"Half-past eight, if you please, mother. I
want to be there in time to ask directions of
Mrs. Prior before she leaves."</p>

<p>Mildred was not sorry to seek the quiet and
solitude of her own room, but she scarcely
slept. She seemed to have but just fallen into
a doze when Rupert knocked at her door to
say that it wanted but ten minutes of the time
she had set for starting, and he was ready to
see her to her destination.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you came early," was Mrs. Prior's
greeting, "for indeed I ought to be at home
seeing to things there. They're pretty sure to
go at sixes and sevens when I'm away; and
even if my boarders don't growl about it,
'tain't treatin' 'em exactly fair. But I'll not
leave you alone with her. Claudina'll be here
directly, and I'll stay till she comes."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" Mildred said. "I
shouldn't like to be left alone with any one
who is so ill, and I shall need to be told just
what I'm to do. How is she now?"</p>

<p>"Can't last much longer, poor thing," Mrs.
Prior returned with a sad shake of the head;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
"she's dreadful weak and short o' breath, and
awful afraid to go. Dear, dear, to think of
anybody putting off preparation to the last
minute when they <em>know</em> they've got to die,
and after that the judgment! And she won't
allow a minister to come into the house, or let
anybody say a word to her about her soul.
Several has tried; I have myself, but it's no
use. Perhaps if she'd been approached in the
right way at first, it might have been different.
Damaris Drybread was the first, I believe, to
say anything to her; and between you and me,
though Damaris means well, she's not always
over wise in her way of doing what she considers
her duty. But there! I must run back
to her. She oughtn't to be left alone a minute.
Come into the sitting-room and take off your
things."</p>

<p>The door into the next room, where the invalid
lay, was open, and Mildred could hear
her moaning and complaining in hollow, despairing
tones, Mrs. Prior answering in cheerful,
soothing accents.</p>

<p>Presently Mrs. Prior stepped back to the
door and beckoned Mildred in.</p>

<p>"This is Miss Keith, Mrs. Martin," she said.
"She and Miss Chetwood will watch with you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
to-night and do all they can to make you comfortable."</p>

<p>"Yes, you're all very kind. I know you'd
help me if you could; but nobody can give
me a minute's ease, and nobody knows what I
have to suffer," moaned the sick woman, gazing
piteously into the fresh young face bending
over her.</p>

<p>Mildred's eyes filled with tears, and she
opened her lips to speak, but was stopped by
a hasty exclamation: "Hush! don't say a word!
don't talk to me! don't ask me any questions!
I won't hear it! I can't bear it! I'm too weak."</p>

<p>"I can only pray for her," was Mildred's
thought as she turned sorrowfully away and
hastened to the outer door, where some one
had rapped lightly.</p>

<p>It was Claudina, and after giving them the
necessary instructions Mrs. Prior left them to
their melancholy duty.</p>

<p>As there was not more to be done than one
could easily attend to, she had advised them to
take turns in watching and sleeping. There
was a lounge in the sitting-room, where one
might rest very comfortably; Claudina stretched
herself on it and almost immediately fell
asleep, Mildred having chosen the first watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter established herself in the sickroom
in an arm-chair by the bedside. She had
brought a book, but the night lamp did not
give sufficient light for reading.</p>

<p>The invalid slept fitfully, tossing, moaning,
and sighing in her sleep, and still more during
her moments of wakefulness.</p>

<p>Mildred had never felt wider awake, so
strangely, fearfully solemn it seemed to sit
there alone, waiting the coming of the angel
of death to one who shuddered and shrank at
his approach. Again and again while the dying
woman slept her watcher knelt by the
bedside and poured out fervent though silent
petitions on her behalf. And for Charlie too;
for her thoughts were full of him as well, and
oh! at that moment it seemed a small matter
that they might never meet on earth, could she
only have the blessed assurance that eternity
would unite them in another and better world.</p>

<p>"What's that you're doing?" asked the
patient, waking suddenly. "Oh, I'm in awful
distress! Rub me with some of that liniment,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Mildred complied, doing her best to give
relief to the physical suffering, and crying
mightily in her heart to the Great Physician
for the healing of the sin-sick soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, the distress and anguish in those hollow,
sunken eyes, and expressed in every lineament
of the wasted features!</p>

<p>The bony hand clutched wildly at Mildred's
dress and drew her down close, while the pale
lips gasped, "I'm dying, and I'm not prepared!
But I can't think&mdash;I'm too weak. I must
wait till I get stronger."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no! come now to Jesus! He waits
with open arms to receive you," cried Mildred,
the tears coursing fast down her cheeks. "He
died to save you, and he is able and willing
to save to the uttermost all who come to him.
Come now."</p>

<p>"Too late, too late! I'm too weak! I can't
think! Don't talk to me any more."</p>

<p>Mildred's ear barely caught the faintly
breathed words, and with the last the hollow
eyes closed, whether in sleep she could not tell.</p>

<p>She found herself growing very weary, and
the hands of the clock pointed to a half hour
past the set time for her vigil. She stole softly
into the next room, roused Claudina, and took
her place.</p>

<p>Her last thought as she fell into a dreamless
slumber was a prayer for the two for whom she
had been so importunately pleading.</p>

<p>She had not slept more than a moment when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
a hand was laid on her shoulder, and Claudina's
voice, trembling with fright, said, "Mildred,
Mildred, O Mildred, she's gone!"</p>

<p>"Who?" she asked, starting up only half
awake.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Martin. I was rubbing her, and she
moaned out, 'I'm too weak. I can't think. I
must wait till I'm stronger,' and with the last
word turned her head, gasped once, and was
gone."</p>

<p>Claudina shuddered and hid her face. "O
Mildred," she whispered, "those words of our
Saviour are ringing in my ears, 'What shall it
profit a man if he shall gain the whole world
and lose his own soul?' As a girl her head
was full of dress and beaux and having a good
time; as a married woman&mdash;keeping the best
table, the neatest house, and helping her husband
to get on in the world. She had no time
to think about her soul until sickness came,
and then she said she was too weak, she must
wait to grow stronger."</p>

<p>They clasped each other's hands and wept
silently.</p>

<p>Presently there was a sound of some one
moving about the kitchen. "The girl's up,"
said Claudina, rising from her kneeling posture
beside the lounge. "I'll go and tell her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and she'll let Mr. Martin know. O, the poor,
motherless baby!"</p>

<p>She left the room, and Mildred, starting up,
saw through the crack at the side of the window-blind
that the sun had risen and Mrs. Prior
was at the door, come to inquire how the sick
woman was.</p>

<p>Through the sweet morning air, pure and
bracing after yesterday's showers, Mildred
walked home, full of solemn, anxious thoughts:
Charlie was a wanderer, she knew not whither,
his absorbing desire and anxiety to retrieve his
broken fortunes. "Oh that he would seek
first the kingdom of God and his righteousness!"
Henceforward that should be the burden
of her prayer for him, for herself, for all
her dear ones.</p>

<p>Then her heart was filled with a great
thankfulness for the spared lives of all these.
Some of them had already made preparation
for that last, long journey which, sooner or
later, every son and daughter of Adam must
take, and to the others time was still given.</p>

<p>Yes, it was joy and gladness just to be alive
this sweet spring morning. The swift-flowing
river gleamed and sparkled in the sunlight;
the forest trees on the farther side were
touched with a tender yellow green; the
grass along the wayside and in the dooryards
was of a deeper, richer hue, and spangled
thickly with violets and dandelions, and the
peach and cherry trees in the gardens were in
full bloom; the air was filled with fragrance,
and with the twittering of birds, the ripple of
the water, and other pleasant rural sounds.</p>

<p>The music of glad young voices came pleasantly
to Mildred's ear as she reached her
father's gate, and Fan and Annis, who had
been stooping over the flower-beds, came
bounding to meet her with a joyous greeting.</p>

<p>"How is mother?" was her first question.</p>

<p>"Well; she's downstairs in the sitting-room
cutting out sewing work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; she's sure to be busy," Mildred said,
hurrying into the house, bidding good-morning,
as she passed, to Ada, who was sweeping
the front porch.</p>

<p>Every one was busy with a cheerful, energetic
activity; Zillah preparing breakfast, while
Celestia Ann put out her clothes to dry;
Rupert milked the cow, and the younger boys
fed the chickens.</p>

<p>"Mother! so early at work after your sickness
yesterday," Mildred said in a tone of
affectionate remonstrance as she entered the
sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter dear, there is need, and I
am quite able for it," Mrs. Keith answered,
looking up with a cheery smile. "And you
are not looking so worn and jaded as I feared
to see you. Did you get some sleep? and
how is the poor sick woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, I slept several hours, and am
feeling pretty well. Mrs. Martin died about
half an hour ago&mdash;very suddenly at the last.
Claudina was with her. I was asleep."</p>

<p>Mildred's eyes filled and her voice was
husky with emotion as she told of the solemn
event.</p>

<p>A silent shake of the head was the only
answer she could give to her mother's next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
question, whether the dying woman had given
any evidence that she was putting her trust in
Christ.</p>

<p>A look of sadness and pain came over the
face of the Christian mother also, while her
heart sent up a silent, fervent prayer on behalf
of her dear ones, that each of them might be
found at last hidden in the Rock of Ages.</p>

<p>"My dear child," she said to Mildred, "let
us look upon this sad event as a solemn warning
to us to be more faithful and constant in
the work of striving to win souls to Christ;
remembering that 'the night cometh, when no
man can work.' Ah! can I be sure that I am
utterly guiltless of the blood of this woman, to
whom I never spoke one word of warning or
entreaty?"</p>

<p>"Mother, don't blame yourself!" cried Mildred
in almost indignant surprise. "You had
not even a speaking acquaintance with her."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, I might have had. I could
easily have found some excuse for calling upon
her in her sickness, had I not allowed myself
to be too much taken up with other cares and
duties."</p>

<p>"But you can't do everything and take care
of everybody," said Mildred with affectionate
warmth; "and you are always at some good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and useful work. It is I who ought to take
the lesson to heart. And, God helping me, I
will," she added, in low, earnest, trembling
tones. "O mother, I feel this morning that
the things of this world are as nothing compared
with those of the next, and I want to
show by my life that I do feel so! I want to
spend it wholly in the Master's service, particularly
in winning souls; for, oh! the awful
thought of one being lost."</p>

<p>That these were no idle, lightly spoken
words, was proven as days, weeks, and months
rolled on, by the ever-growing consistency of
Mildred's daily walk and conversation; her
constant effort to bring her daily life into conformity
to the divine precept, "Whether therefore
ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do
all to the glory of God;" and that other, "As
we have therefore opportunity, let us do good
unto all men, especially unto them who are of
the household of faith."</p>

<p>The members of the home-circle were the
first to feel the change in Mildred. She could
hardly have made herself more helpful than
she had long been, but her cheerfulness was
more uniform, and the younger ones found
her more patient with their shortcomings,
more ready with sympathy and help in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
little trials and perplexities. They soon learned
to carry them to her as readily as to their best
and kindest of mothers. They thought their
eldest sister very wise, and liked to consult
her about their plans. This gave her many an
opportunity to influence them for good, and
very rarely was it neglected.</p>

<p>Spring was a very busy season with them
all; within doors house-cleaning and a vast
amount of sewing&mdash;so many new garments to
be made, so many old ones to be renovated
and altered to suit the increased stature of the
growing lads and lasses; outside the gardening,
the making everything neat and trim, and
the care of the poultry.</p>

<p>Lessons were intermitted for two or three
weeks, to give the older members of the family
time for their unusual labors, while the children
revelled in the delights of digging, planting,
and sowing, looking after their sitting
hens and tending their broods of little chicks.
There was a great deal of healthful pleasure
gotten out of the little plots of ground appropriated
in severalty to Cyril, Don, Fan, and
Annis, and hardly less from their fowls; besides,
the young owners were learning habits
of industry and thrift; also the enjoyment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
being able to give to the Lord's cause of that
which had cost them something.</p>

<p>A beggar was a thing almost unknown in
the town, and there were very few people
poor enough to be objects of charity; but it
was nice, the children thought, to have something
of their very own to put into the church
or Sabbath-school collection, especially when
it was to go to buy Bibles and pay for sending
missionaries to the poor benighted heathen.</p>

<p>The cause of missions was dear to the hearts
of the parents, and they were training their
children to love and work for it.</p>

<p>Rupert was the principal gardener and
manager of outdoor matters. He had full
charge of the fruit and vegetable garden on
his father's ground, and it flourished under
his care. But not content with that, he had
his own lot and Mildred's&mdash;which he undertook
to cultivate upon shares&mdash;ploughed
up, then sowed them with corn, potatoes and
melons.</p>

<p>He had his mother's talent for system; and,
making the best use of every spare moment,
an early riser, industrious, energetic, and painstaking,
he managed to do all this without neglecting
the studies, in preparation for college,
which he was still pursuing with Mr. Lord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>He even found time for setting out trees
and shrubs, and digging up the flower-beds in
the front and side yards; doing all the hard
work needed there, then giving them into the
care of his mother and the older girls, who
contrived to spare to the pleasing task an occasional
half hour morning and evening, finding
it a rest from almost constant toil with the
needle.</p>

<p>Cheerfully busy as Mildred was from morning
to night, Charlie was seldom absent from
her thoughts: she followed him in imagination
through all his wanderings, the unbidden
tears often springing to her eyes as she dwelt
upon the loneliness and hardships he was doubtless
called to endure; her only comfort that
she might constantly plead for him with that
almighty Friend who knew it all, and was ever
near to both herself and her loved one.</p>

<p>She hoped, she prayed, that Charlie might
be restored to her, with the barrier to their
union removed; but most of all, that whether
she should ever see him again on earth or not,
he might inherit eternal life.</p>

<p>Her father and mother, Rupert, and Zillah
were the only members of the family who
knew anything of the matter; the others
never so much as suspected that their bright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
kind, helpful, sympathizing sister Milly was
burdened with a secret sorrow or care.</p>

<p>Nor did she make a confidante of Claudina
Chetwood, Lu Grange or Effie Prescott, though
on intimate terms with all three.</p>

<p>Effie's health had improved since the Keiths
first made her acquaintance, but she was still
feeble and often ailing. She was a girl of fine
mind, very fond of reading, and very thankful
to these good neighbors for their kindness in
lending her books and periodicals. And she
greatly enjoyed a chat with Mrs. Keith or
Mildred, for which the borrowing and returning
afforded frequent occasion.</p>

<p>She came in one morning while they were
hard at work over the pile of spring sewing.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, ladies. Don't let me disturb
you," she said, as Zillah dropped her
work and rose hastily to hand a chair. "I see
you are very busy, and I came to ask if you
would let me help. I should enjoy spending
the morning chatting with you all, and might
just as well work while I talk; and I have
brought my thimble," taking it from her
pocket as she spoke.</p>

<p>"That is a very kind offer, Miss Effie, and
we will be glad to have you. Take yon easy-chair
and chat with us as long as you will,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Mrs. Keith said, with her pleasant smile; "but
that, I think, will be quite sufficient exertion
after your walk."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; you must get quite enough
of sewing at home," said Zillah; "it takes so
many, many stitches to make even one garment,
and such lots of garments to clothe a
family at all respectably."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Effie in a sprightly tone,
"but I am fond of my needle and can use it a
good deal without injury. Mildred, I see you
are working buttonholes&mdash;my especial pride
and delight. Won't you hand that waist to
me, and find something else to occupy your
fingers?"</p>

<p>"Do you like to make them?" asked Mildred
in a tone of genuine surprise. "It is my
perfect detestation. Therefore I find myself
sorely tempted to accept your generous offer."</p>

<p>Before Mildred's sentence was completed
the work had exchanged hands, Effie taking
playfully forcible possession.</p>

<p>"My dear girl, you have a real genius for
the business!" Mildred exclaimed presently.
"How rapidly and nicely you work them! two
done in less time than I should take for one,
without doing it half so well."</p>

<p>Effie's eyes sparkled. "Generous praise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Mildred," she said; "but you can well afford
to allow me the credit of doing one little thing
better than you do it."</p>

<p>"I dare say there may be many others in
which you excel me."</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe there's any other; and
oh, when I hear you play the piano I feel as if
I'd give anything in the world if I could play
even half as well."</p>

<p>"Would you like to take lessons?"</p>

<p>"Shouldn't I!" cried Effie, with emphasis.
"But, dear me, there's no use thinking of it,
as I'm not likely ever to have the chance."</p>

<p>"I'd rather give a music lesson any day than
work buttonholes," remarked Mildred laughingly;
"and oh, the quantities of them to be
made in this family! Effie, why shouldn't we
exchange work occasionally?&mdash;an hour of instruction
on the piano for an hour's sewing?
Don't you think it would do, mother?"</p>

<p>"Capitally, if you are mutually satisfied."</p>

<p>Effie's face was sparkling with delight. "Oh,
do you really mean it?" she cried. "Why, I'd
gladly give two hours' sewing for one of music
lesson, and am sure it would be worth it."</p>

<p>"No," said Mildred, "I think not, considering
what a swift and neat needlewoman you
are."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not much worldly wisdom in either of
you, I think, my dear girls," remarked Mrs.
Keith with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"But there's a difficulty I had not thought
of," said Effie. "I have no piano to practise
on."</p>

<p>"You shall have the use of mine."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I gladly accept your kind offer
if I may pay for that also with my needle."</p>

<p>Effie spent the day with her friends, and
before leaving had come to an arrangement
with Mildred perfectly satisfactory to both,
and taken her first lesson.</p>

<p>Just at its close, before the two had left the
piano, Claudina and Lu came in, and, hearing
what Mildred had undertaken, earnestly begged
that she would add them to her class.</p>

<p>"Father is very anxious for me to learn,"
said Claudina, "and was wondering, the other
day, if it would do to ask you to take me as a
scholar. He said you could set your own
price; he'd willingly pay it; but as you have
no need to make money for yourself he was
afraid to propose it. Now, Milly dear, would
you be offended? Of course we should feel
that you were doing us a favor, even though
you let us pay for it."</p>

<p>"No; I don't feel at all offended," Mildred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
said, laughing and blushing, "and I'd be glad
to do anything in my power to gratify you,
girls, or your fathers; but I really haven't
time."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose we'll have to give it up,"
remarked Lu with a sigh; "but I do wish
this town could afford a music teacher, for I've
set my heart on learning to play."</p>

<p>"When spring house-cleaning and sewing are
done you won't be so very busy, Milly," suggested
Claudina.</p>

<p>"Yes, very nearly if not quite as busy as
now, for then I take up my governessing
again."</p>

<p>"You're the best sister and daughter I ever
heard of," was Claudina's comment.</p>

<p>Tea was just over, and Mrs. Keith stepped
out to the kitchen for a consultation with
Celestia Ann on the all-important subject of
the morrow's breakfast and dinner. Returning
to the sitting-room, she found her three girls
again plying their needles.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my dears, no more work to-night,"
she said. "You, Zillah and Ada, may
help me set everything to rights here, so that
we can go on promptly in the morning; and
Mildred, child, if you are not too tired, let
your father have some music. It is restful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and cheering to him after his day's work and
worry at the office."</p>

<p>"I'm never too tired to play for father or
mother," Mildred said with a smile as she rose
to do her mother's bidding.</p>

<p>"There! don't wait to fold that; I'll do it,"
Zillah said, taking the work from her hand.
"And, mother, please go into the parlor and
rest yourself in the big rocking-chair, and leave
this clearing up to Ada and me."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, please do," chimed in the
younger girl; "we'd a great deal rather, and
you know we can just as well as not."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dears; then I will. What
comforts and blessings you are to me! all three
of you."</p>

<p>"Me too, mother?&mdash;me and Fan?" asked
little Annis, following and standing beside her
mother's chair with eager, upturned face and
pleading eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, darling! Mother wouldn't
know how to do without her baby girl or her
dear little Fan," Mrs. Keith answered, lifting
the one into her lap and drawing the other
close to her side; for Fan, too, had followed
her in from the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"I'm not of much use yet, mother, 'cept to
love you," she said, nestling closer; "but I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
going to be some day, if I live. See! I've
hemmed one side o' this handkerchief; and
didn't I make nice bits of stitches?" she asked,
holding it up for inspection.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, darling, I can see that you
have taken great pains. Why, I think after a
while I shall have no need to sew at all, with
so many other fingers to do the work. Go and
show it to father."</p>

<p>Fan obeyed, was praised, caressed and taken
upon her father's knee, where she sat in quiet
content listening to Mildred's music.</p>

<p>Presently Squire Chetwood was ushered in
by Celestia Ann.</p>

<p>"Go on, Miss Mildred," he said as he took
the seat Mr. Keith hastened to offer; "there's
no greater treat for me than your music; and
my errand will keep for a bit."</p>

<p>It proved, when told, one that rejoiced them
all. It was to show to Mr. Keith a letter of
acceptance from a gentleman teacher with
whom they had been corresponding with a
view to securing his services as principal of a
school which they were trying to establish in
the town. It was to be for both sexes, and
the gentleman's wife would take charge of the
girls' department.</p>

<p>"I send four pupils&mdash;Zillah, Ada, Cyril, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Don," said Mr. Keith, "thereby considerably
lightening your labors, wife, and Mildred's, I
trust."</p>

<p>The squire cleared his throat. "And then,
Miss Mildred&mdash;Ah! I hardly dare go on lest
you should think me presuming."</p>

<p>"But after exciting my curiosity you can
hardly refuse to gratify it," Mildred returned
playfully, though she knew very well what was
coming.</p>

<p>Before the squire went away she had consented
to take another music scholar, and the
terms he offered were very liberal, she having
declined to name a price for her services.</p>

<p>"Having accepted Claudina, you can hardly
refuse Lu," her mother remarked when the
squire had gone.</p>

<p>"No, mother; and how little time I shall
have left for helping you!" sighed Mildred.</p>

<p>"Now, Milly, don't try to make yourself of
so much importance!" cried Zillah in a gayly
bantering tone. "Didn't mother do without
you entirely last year? One would suppose
Ada and I were of no consequence where work
is concerned."</p>

<p>"But you will be in school, child!"</p>

<p>"Not for the first four hours after we leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
our beds in the morning, or the last four or
five before we return to them at night."</p>

<p>"Beside an hour or more at noon," added
Ada; "and if we can't do something to help
mother in all that time we'll deserve to be
called lazy girls."</p>

<p>"We shall do nicely, I am sure," the mother
said, with a pleased, loving glance at each of
the three faces in turn. "I think we can manage
so that everything will be attended to, and
no one of us overworked. I can easily hear
Fan's and Annis's little lessons every day while
sewing. Your five music scholars, Mildred,
will occupy only ten hours a week of your
time, while one of them will do an hour's
sewing for you every day and the other two
outsiders bring you in a nice little sum of
pocket money."</p>

<p>"Why, it doesn't look so very laborious after
all!" Mildred said, brightening.</p>

<p>"No," laughed Zillah, "you could take half
a dozen more music scholars and not be hurt."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wouldst thou from sorrow find a sweet relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or is thy heart oppress'd with woes untold?<br /></span>

</div></div>


<p>Mildred's charity, beginning at home, did
not end there: very earnestly and persistently
she strove to scatter blessings as "a shower of
gold" wherever she went; to make every life
that came in contact with hers, at ever so small
a point, the better and brighter for that contact,
though it were by but a cheery word or
smile.</p>

<p>Do you say these are small matters, scarcely
worthy of attention? Ah! to each of us comes
the divine command, "Be pitiful, be courteous;"
and the Master said of the tithing of
mint, anise, and cummin, while the weightier
matters of the law were neglected, "These
ought ye to have done, and not to leave the
other undone." "He that is faithful in that
which is least, is faithful also in much."</p>

<p>It was so with Mildred; never considering
herself off duty as a Christian soldier, she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
as ready to feed the hungry, clothe the naked,
teach the ignorant, and nurse the sick, as to
bestow the kind word and pleasant smile that
cost her nothing. Nothing? Ah! there were
times of weariness and depression when even
these trifles cost a heroic effort&mdash;a determined
setting aside of selfish inclination to moodiness
or irritability, or indulgence in a pleasing melancholy,
because one great earthly blessing was
denied her.</p>

<p>In this her bright, cheerful mother, always
ready with a word of counsel and encouragement,
was a wonderful help. Indeed, by frequent
precept and constant example Mrs.
Keith succeeded in making all her children, to
a greater or less degree, sunny tempered and
benevolent, kind and courteous.</p>

<p>The Dorcas society connected with their
church had no more active, efficient, or liberal
members than this good lady and her eldest
daughter; in proportion to their ability, they
gave freely of time, labor, and money. They
were, indeed, always found ready to every
good work, though they trusted not in their
works for acceptance in the sight of God, but
only in the atoning blood and imputed righteousness
of Christ. "Followers of God as
dear children," theirs was a service of love and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
joy, rendered not that they might be saved,
but because they were saved.</p>

<p>Questions of doctrine and duty were freely
discussed in the family circle, the children
bringing them in all confidence to their parents
for decision, the parents always appealing to
the Scriptures as the one infallible rule of
faith and practice&mdash;as they are in very truth.</p>

<p>"To the law and to the testimony: if they
speak not according to this word, it is because
there is no light in them." "For the commandment
is a lamp, and the law is light."</p>

<p>One Sabbath a returned missionary preached
in the morning to Mr. Lord's congregation, in
the afternoon addressed the assembled Sunday-schools
of the town.</p>

<p>The Keiths came home from the latter service
very full of what they had heard of the
sad condition of the heathen world, the need
of money to carry on the work of evangelizing
them, and the self-denying efforts some of
God's children, both old and young, were making
to earn and save that they might be able
to give to this good cause.</p>

<p>Cyril had been especially interested in the
story of a little boy who had raised a pig, sold
it, and given to missions the whole of what he
received for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean to have a missionary pig," Cyril
said to Don as they walked home together.
"I'll take good care of it and feed it well, so
it will be very fat, so that I can get ten dollars
for it; and every cent of it shall go to the
missionaries. And I'll make more besides
for them out of my garden and my chickens."</p>

<p>"So will I," said Don; "but I shan't let
'em have all the money."</p>

<p>"How much, then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it won't do for all of us to have
pigs," said Ada, overhearing the talk of her
little brothers.</p>

<p>"No," laughed Zillah; "we'd overstock the
market and bring down the price."</p>

<p>"I don't see what I can do then, except give
some of my pocket-money; unless mother will
pay me for doing without butter and tea and
sugar, as some of the children do that the missionary
told about."</p>

<p>"That's too hard a way," said Cyril; "you
won't catch me trying that: I'll work for the
heathen, but I won't starve for 'em."</p>

<p>"It would be hard; but we ought to deny
ourselves," Ada returned half regretfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, in some things," Zillah said: "I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
feel sure about this. We'll ask father and
mother."</p>

<p>They did so immediately on entering the
house.</p>

<p>"Your mother and I have just been discussing
that question," Mr. Keith said, "and we
think that as good, nourishing food is necessary
to your health and growth, it is not a duty
for you to deny yourselves such common comforts
as butter and sugar. There are other and
better ways in which to practise self-denial."</p>

<p>"How, father?" asked Ada.</p>

<p>"It might be by denying our love of ease&mdash;working
and earning for the good of others,
when we would rather be at play; the Bible
speaks of laboring, working with our hands
that we may have to give to him that needeth."</p>

<p>"And who more needy than the poor, benighted
heathen!" sighed Mrs. Keith.</p>

<p>"It won't hurt us to deny ourselves in the
matter of finery," remarked Mildred.</p>

<p>"Or eating more than enough to satisfy our
appetites, just because it tastes good," added
Rupert.</p>

<p>"No, that is sinful in itself, because injurious
to health," said his father.</p>

<p>"But haven't we a right to eat what we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
please, and just as much as we choose, if we
would rather be sick than do without the good
things, father?" asked Cyril.</p>

<p>"No, my son; health is one of God's good
gifts, which we have no right to throw away.
We can't serve him with a sick and suffering
body so well as with a strong, healthy one.
And we are told in Proverbs, 'The drunkard
and the glutton shall come to poverty.'"</p>

<p>"Father, does God want us to give all our
money away to other folks?" asked Don.</p>

<p>"No, son, not all; our heavenly Father intends
us to use some of it to supply our own
needs."</p>

<p>"What proportion ought we to give, father?"
asked Rupert.</p>

<p>"I think that depends upon how large our
means are."</p>

<p>"Is not a tenth the Bible rule?" asked Mrs.
Keith.</p>

<p>"Yes; God claims a tenth as his. It seems
plain that every one should give that, or more
properly pay it to the Lord; and those who
are able to do more, add offerings in proportion
to their ability. So I gather from this text in
Malachi, third chapter and eighth verse;" and
opening a Bible, Mr. Keith read aloud: "'Will
a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee?
In tithes and offerings.'"</p>

<p>"I thought that was the rule under the Levitical
law, and that the New Testament rule
was, 'Give as God has prospered you,'" said
Rupert.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are to give as God has prospered
us&mdash;one dollar out of every ten, one hundred
out of every thousand, and so on. The beginning
of tithe-paying was not in the time of
Moses, but hundreds of years before; for we
read that Abraham paid tithes, and that Jacob
promised to the Lord the tenth of all that he
should give him. We nowhere read that Jesus
abrogated this law; indeed he said, 'Think
not that I am come to destroy the law or the
prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to
fulfil;' of the tithing of 'mint and rue and all
manner of herbs,' that it ought not to be left
undone. And God promises blessings, both
temporal and spiritual, to those who faithfully
obey this law of the tithes. 'Bring ye all the
tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
meat in mine house; and prove me now herewith,
saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open
you the windows of heaven, and pour you out
a blessing, that there shall not be room enough
to receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the
fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine
cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith
the Lord of hosts.'</p>

<p>"'Honor the Lord with thy substance and
with the first-fruits of all thine increase: so
shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy
presses shall burst out with new wine.'</p>

<p>"'Trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt
thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt
be fed.'</p>

<p>"'There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth;
and there is that withholdeth more than
is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.'</p>

<p>"'He that hath pity upon the poor, lendeth
unto the Lord; and that which he hath given
will he pay him again.'</p>

<p>"These are not all the texts bearing on the
subject, but will suffice for the present."</p>

<p>"Father," said Don, "God doesn't need our
money, does he? Why does he tell us to give
it to him?"</p>

<p>"For our own good, my son. Don't you
remember Jesus said, 'It is more blessed to
give than to receive'? He cannot be happy
who indulges a mean, sordid disposition; the
less selfish we are, the more ready to help
others and share our good things with them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>,
the happier and the more like our heavenly
Father we shall be. Try it, my boy, and you
will find it is so. And the more constantly
we practise giving, the more we shall be in
love with it."</p>

<p>"And then shall our gifts be pleasing to
God," added the mother. "'Every man according
as he purposeth in his heart, so let
him live; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for
God loveth a cheerful giver. And God is able
to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
always having all sufficiency in all things, may
abound to every good work.'"</p>

<p>"Well, it seems, if we obey the Bible rule,
we will give a tenth of our pocket-money, and
of all we can make beside," remarked Rupert.</p>

<p>"And I am very glad I can earn something
by teaching music," said Mildred.</p>

<p>"I think you can each find some way of
earning something for this good purpose," the
mother said, glancing smilingly around the
little group.</p>

<p>Cyril told eagerly of his plan. Don adding
that he meant to have a missionary pig too,
but not to give all that he made on it.</p>

<p>"You must decide for yourself whether to
give more than a tenth of its price," his father
said; "but I think 'missionary pig' will hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
be an appropriate name unless it is entirely
devoted to the cause."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Fan, "wouldn't it be nice
for me to call one of my hens a missionary
hen, and give all the money I get for her and
her eggs to the heathen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I think it would be very nice,"
Mrs. Keith answered, with a loving glance into
the earnest little face.</p>

<p>"Then I'll do it, and I hope she'll lay an
egg every day."</p>

<p>"And I'll have a missionary hen!" cried
little Annis, clapping her hands with delight
at the idea of contributing her mite to the
good cause.</p>

<p>"Ada and I haven't matured our plans yet,"
said Zillah, "but we'll be sure to find some
way to make money, as well as the rest of you."</p>

<p>"Mother will help us to contrive it; won't
you, mother?" Ada said, with a look of confiding
affection.</p>

<p>The answer was a prompt, emphatic "Yes,
indeed, my dear."</p>

<p>But Mr. Keith seemed to have something
further to say, and all turned to listen.</p>

<p>"We want to give the missionary some
money to-day or to-morrow to carry away with
him. Who has any ready now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Cyril's countenance fell. He was a great
spendthrift, and money slipped through his
fingers almost as soon as it came into his possession.</p>

<p>"My pocket-money's all gone," he sighed,
half aloud, half to himself; then nudging his
younger brother, "Don, you always have some:
won't you lend me a little?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Keith, "you are not to go
into debt, even from a good motive. After
this, set aside the Lord's tenth of all your
money as soon as it comes into your hands,
and use that portion scrupulously for him in
giving to the church and the poor. And, my
son, I want you to form the habit of laying by
a little for your own future needs. You will
be a poor man if you spend all your money as
fast as you get it."</p>

<p>"I don't," remarked Don complacently; "I
save 'most all I get."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, my boy, I know that, and often
feel troubled about my youngest son lest he
should become a hard, grasping, miserly man,
loving and hoarding money for its own sake.
Do you know that that is as truly idolatry as
the bowing down of the heathen to images of
wood and stone?"</p>

<p>"Is it, father?" murmured the little lad, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
face crimsoning, and the tears starting to his
eyes.</p>

<p>"It is indeed, Don; and so a worse fault
than Cyril's foolish spending, bad as that is.
The Bible bids us mortify 'covetousness,
which is idolatry.'"</p>

<p>"Try, both of you, to save in order 'to have
to give to him that needeth,' and to 'provide
things honest in the sight of all men.' We
must first pay to the Lord his tenth, then to
our fellow-men what we honestly owe them;
after that give to the needy what we feel able
to spare from our store. Not pull down our
barns and build greater, there to bestow our
surplus goods, while we take our ease, eat,
drink, and be merry, and neglect to relieve
the distress and suffering of the poor and
needy."</p>

<p>"Like the rich man in the Bible," said Fan.
"Father, was he a very bad man?"</p>

<p>"Probably not what the world calls bad;
we are not told that he was dishonest, drunken,
or profane; but he was selfish and covetous&mdash;caring
for the good things of this world and
neglectful of eternal things; and selfishness is
sin as well as covetousness. They seem to go
together and shut the soul out of heaven. The
Bible says, 'Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall
inherit the kingdom of God."</p>

<p>"I thought coveting was wanting other
people's things," remarked Ada.</p>

<p>"That is coveting," replied her father, "and
so is that inordinate love of gain, which leads
men to drive hard bargains, and to heap up
riches at the expense of leaving those to suffer
whom they are fully able to relieve. When
the Lord gives us large means, it is that, as his
stewards, we may distribute to others. Well,
Rupert, what is it?"</p>

<p>"I have the money I had saved toward
buying a piano. I will give a tenth of it
now."</p>

<p>"That is well. Who else has anything for
the missionary?"</p>

<p>"I have a little of the pocket-money Aunt
Wealthy supplies," Mildred said. "I wish I
could give more now. I hope to when the
money comes in from my music scholars; but
that will not be for some time, you know."</p>

<p>"I haven't much money," said Fan, "but
maybe I can sell my eggs. I have a whole
dozen."</p>

<p>"I'll give some of my money," said Don.</p>

<p>"And I," "And I," said Zillah and Ada.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith also promised something, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
Mr. Keith added that he, too, would give, and
they would collect it all and hand it to the
missionary before his departure, which was to
be the next afternoon.</p>

<p>"Father, is it right to pray for earthly prosperity?"
asked Rupert.</p>

<p>"That depends very much upon the motive.
The apostle James says, 'Ye have not, because
ye ask not. Ye ask, and receive not, because
ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon
your lusts.' It is not the asking he condemns
(he seems, indeed, to reprove them for not asking),
but the wrong motive for so doing. Let
us compare Scripture with Scripture. The
Psalmist tells us, 'Except the Lord build the
house, they labor in vain that build it: except
the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh
but in vain. It is vain for you to rise up
early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows;
for so he giveth his beloved sleep.'</p>

<p>"In Deuteronomy we are told, 'Thou shalt
remember the Lord thy God, for it is he that
giveth thee power to get wealth.' Evidently
we cannot attain to worldly prosperity except
by God's help&mdash;his blessing on our efforts.
We may work for prosperity, and we may
pray for it, from either a right or a wrong
motive, and certainly in either case we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
approved or the contrary according to the
motive that actuates us. 'Man looketh on
the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh
on the heart.'"</p>

<p>"What would be a right motive, father?"
asked Ada in her grave, earnest way.</p>

<p>"The desire to have the ability to 'provide
things honest in the sight of all men,' to help
on the Lord's cause&mdash;the work of the church&mdash;and
to give to the poor and needy. Many desire
wealth for their own ease and indulgence,
for the consequence it gives them in the eyes
of their fellow-men, or as a means of gaining
power over them. It cannot be right to pray
for it from such motives&mdash;that is the sort of
asking the apostle condemns."</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith was turning over the leaves of
the Bible. "Let the Lord be magnified, who
hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servants,"
she read aloud. "What the Lord takes
pleasure in, and what he promises upon conditions,
it cannot be wrong to ask for, unless
from a wrong motive," she remarked. "And
it is clear to my mind that if it be wrong to
pray for prosperity, it is also wrong to work
for it; certainly a Christian should never engage
in anything upon which he cannot ask
God's blessing. But we are commanded to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
'diligent in business,' and told that 'the hand
of the diligent maketh rich.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her husband, "'Not slothful in
business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.'
If we are careful not to divorce these two
which God hath joined together, we need not
fear to ask his blessing on our labors."</p>

<p>The new school had opened the previous
week, and was now in successful operation.
Zillah and Ada were pursuing their studies
with redoubled zeal and interest, finding a
constant spur in the desire to keep pace with,
if not outstrip, the other members of their
classes.</p>

<p>Mildred was often applied to for help in the
home preparation of their lessons, and her assistance,
always cheerfully and kindly given,
received with due appreciation.</p>

<p>"With such good help at home," they would
say, "we ought to do better than any of the
other girls; for there isn't one of them who has
a sister so capable of explaining whatever in
their lessons they find difficult to understand,
or so willing to do it."</p>

<p>"I am only returning to you what mother
has done for me in past days," Mildred answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
more than once; "and if I did not do
it she would."</p>

<p>"Yes," was the rejoinder, "there isn't such
another mother in the town, or anywhere else,
for that matter."</p>

<p>The little boys, accustomed to passing most
of the day in the open air, after conning their
tasks on the porch or in the shade of the trees,
found the confinement of the schoolroom very
irksome.</p>

<p>Mother and Mildred were frequently appealed
to for sympathy in their trial; and the
demand was always sure to be met with bright,
hopeful, cheery words of encouragement to patience
and diligence. "They must be willing
to bear with a little discomfort in the pursuit
of the knowledge which was so important to
their future success in life&mdash;must try to learn
all they could, that they might grow up to be
wise, useful men, capable of doing God service,
and of helping themselves and others."</p>

<p>Hitherto the little fellows had been kept out
of the streets and carefully shielded from the
snares and temptations of association with the
evil-disposed and wicked. The time for a trial
of the strength of their principles had now
come, and parents and elder sister looked on
with deep anxiety for the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>The perfect openness engendered in them
by never-failing sympathy in all their little
childish joys and sorrows, plans and purposes,
now proved a wonderful safeguard. Why
should they want to hide anything from those
whose interest in and love for them was made
so apparent? They did not; and so many a
wrong step was avoided or speedily retrieved.</p>

<p>In that first week of school Cyril had got
himself into disgrace with his teacher by a
liberal distribution among his mates of gingerbread
and candy, for which he had spent his
whole store of pocket-money.</p>

<p>The good things were carried into the schoolroom,
the master's attention drawn to them by
the constant munching and crunching among
the boys.</p>

<p>A search was promptly instituted, the remainder
of the feast confiscated, and an explanation
called for.</p>

<p>"Who brought these things here?" was the
stern demand.</p>

<p>"I, sir; I brought them and gave them to
the fellows, and so am more to blame than anybody
else," Cyril said, rising in his seat and
speaking out with manly courage and honesty,
though his cheeks were in a blaze and his
heart beat fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, sir, you shall be punished with the
loss of your recess and being kept in for an
hour after school," was the stern rejoinder.
"I will have no such doings here."</p>

<p>There was not a word of commendation of
the boy's moral courage and readiness to confess
his fault; and he had to endure not only the
loss of his play-time, but also was severely lectured
and threatened with a flogging if ever
the offence should be repeated.</p>

<p>He went home very angry and indignant,
and his mother being out, carried his grievance
to Mildred. He poured out the whole
story without reserve, finishing with "Wasn't
it the greatest shame for him to punish me
twice for the same thing? I'm sure the
loss of my recess was quite enough, 'specially
considering that I owned up the minute he
asked about it. And then the idea of threatening
to flog me! Why, I haven't had a whipping
since I was a little bit of a fellow, and I'd
think it an awful disgrace to get one now I'm
so big; 'specially at school; and I say nobody
but father or mother has a right to touch me.
And nobody shall; I'll just knock old Peacock
down if he dares to try it; that I will!"</p>

<p>"O Cyril, Cyril, you should not be so disrespectful
toward the teacher father has set over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
you!" Mildred said, striving to speak quietly
though between indignation at the severity
and injustice of the treatment the child had
received, and the mirth-provoking idea of his
imagining himself able to cope with a man,
she found it no easy matter. "I'm really sorry
you have wasted your money and broken
the rules."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't!" the boy burst out hotly;
"he'd never made any rule about it; though
he has now, and says I ought to have known
and must have known that such things couldn't
be allowed."</p>

<p>"Well, that seems rather unreasonable; but
I suppose you might if you had stopped to
think. You know, Cyril dear, how often
father and mother have urged you to try to
be more thoughtful."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it seems as if I can't, Milly.
How's a fellow to help being thoughtless and
careless when it comes so natural?"</p>

<p>"Our wicked natures are what we have to
strive against, you know; and God will help
us if we ask him," she answered, speaking that
holy name in low, reverent tones.</p>

<p>Don, who had waited about the school-house
door for Cyril, and walked home by his side,
was standing by listening to the talk. "O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Milly! we don't like that school!" he said,
with a look of weariness and disgust; "It's so
hard to have to be shut up there, and obliged
to sit still most all day long. Won't you ask
father to let us stay at home and say lessons to
you again?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Milly, do!" Cyril joined in. "Fan's
ever so lonesome without us, and we'll be as
good as we know how; study hard, and not
give you a bit of trouble."</p>

<p>Mildred explained that the arrangements
had been made for the summer, and could not
now be altered.</p>

<p>"And surely," she concluded, with an encouraging
smile, "my two little brothers are
not such cowards as to be conquered by little
difficulties and discomforts. Don't you know
we have to meet such things all the way through
life? and the best way is to meet them with a
cheerful courage and determination to press
on notwithstanding. 'The slothful man saith
there is a lion in the way.' 'The way of the
slothful man is as an hedge of thorns.' Don't
be like him."</p>

<p>"Does that mean that folks are lazy when
they give up because things are hard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Don; and if we are so ready to do
that, we are not likely to get to heaven; because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
that is no easy matter&mdash;with our sinful
hearts, a wicked world, and Satan and all his
hosts to fight against. We have to 'fight the
good fight of faith'&mdash;to 'lay hold on eternal
life'&mdash;to 'press toward the mark for the prize
of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus'&mdash;to
'run with patience the race that is set before
us.' Jesus said 'The kingdom of heaven
suffereth violence, and the violent take it by
force.'"</p>

<p>"Milly, what does that mean?"</p>

<p>"That to get to heaven it is necessary to
strive very, very earnestly and determinately."</p>

<p>"Milly, how can Don and I fight that fight?"
asked Cyril. "Do tell us."</p>

<p>"Just as grown people must&mdash;by loving and
trusting Jesus, and striving earnestly every
day and hour to serve God in doing faithfully
the duty that comes nearest to hand. And
don't you see that the principal part of yours
at present is to be good, faithful workers at
school, and obedient to your teacher, because
father has given him authority over you when
you are at school?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I 'spose so," sighed Don. "But O
Milly, I did want to run away this afternoon
and take a nice walk, 'stead of going to school.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
It's so nice down by the river and in the woods
'mong the birds and flowers."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it is, Don; but it would have
been very wrong to go without leave; and I
can't tell you how glad I am that you resisted
the temptation."</p>

<p>Now that money was wanted for the missionary,
Cyril was sorry for having spent his
so foolishly.</p>

<p>"I was very bad to waste it in that way," he
said regretfully; "it was all because I didn't
think; but I mean to think after this, and try
to make the best use of all the money I get."</p>

<p>The new school was nearly as great an affliction
to Fan as to the little boys; she was
so lonely without Cyril and Don&mdash;hitherto her
inseparable companions and playmates; and
now it depended upon her to run errands for
her mother and sister when they were in too
great haste to wait the boys' leisure; and Fan,
being extremely timid and bashful, found this
no small trial.</p>

<p>It was Monday morning; the scholars were
trooping into the schoolhouse&mdash;the Keiths
among the rest.</p>

<p>At home Mildred was in the parlor giving a
music lesson; Fan in the sitting room waiting
for mother to come and hear her read and spell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Keith came in and sat down at her
writing desk.</p>

<p>"Fan, darling, mother wants you to do an
errand for her," she said, taking up her pen.</p>

<p>"What, mother?" the child asked half plaintively.</p>

<p>"To carry a note for me to Mrs. Clark. I
want you to take it there immediately, and tell
her you will wait for an answer. And then,
as you come back, call at Chetwood &amp; Mocker's
and ask for a yard of calico like the piece
I shall give you, and also how they are selling
eggs to-day by the dozen. Then I will buy
your dozen of you, and you will have the money
for the missionary."</p>

<p>"Oh mother," sighed the little girl, "I don't
like to go to the store all alone, or to Mrs.
Clark's either. I don't know her."</p>

<p>"I am sorry my dear little girl is so bashful,
but that is something that must be overcome,
and cannot be except by refusing to indulge
it. You may take Annis with you, though, if
you choose."</p>

<p>"Thank you, mother; but Annis is so little
that I'll have to do all the talking just the
same."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, you can talk quite prettily, if
you only forget to think about yourself. Try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to forget little Fan Keith, and think of the
messages she has to deliver, the questions she
must ask, and you will find there is no trouble
at all."</p>

<p>"O mother! please let somebody else go."</p>

<p>Fan had put down her book, gone to her
mother's side, and was standing there looking
pleadingly into her face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith bent down as she folded her note
and pressed a loving kiss on the white forehead.</p>

<p>"My little girl will go to please mother and
the dear Lord Jesus. There is no one else to
go now, and the errands cannot wait for the
boys to come home from school."</p>

<p>"Will it please Jesus, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, because he bids you honor and
obey your mother, and also to deny yourself
when duty calls. You know one part of the
errand at the store is to help you to the money
for the poor heathen."</p>

<p>"Mother, I'd rather do 'most anything else
for them; but I'll go to please you and the
Lord Jesus. And I want Annis to go too.
Will you, Annis?"</p>

<p>"I guess I <em>will</em>! I'd like to," the little one
answered joyously.</p>

<p>It was a busy morning with Mrs. Keith, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
getting Annis ready for the walk involved
some small loss of time; but she considered
the pleasure she would thus give her little ones
well worth the sacrifice.</p>

<p>"Now, Fan," she said, when the children
were about to start, and she had put the note
and sample of calico into the little girl's hands,
with a repetition of her commissions, "remember
that you are the errand girl and have all
the responsibility, because Annis is too little;
but you are mother's big, useful girl. I know
you are glad to be a help and comfort to
mother."</p>

<p>The tender, loving words infused courage
into the timid little heart for the moment,
and the two set off with bright faces; but
Fan's clouded again, and her heart beat fast as
she neared Mrs. Clark's door.</p>

<p>Had it not been open her timid little rap
would hardly have been heard; and her message,
delivered with the note, was given in
tones so low that the lady had to ask her to
repeat it, while she bent her ear to catch the
words.</p>

<p>At the store it was even worse. Not yet
recovered from the embarrassment of her call
upon Mrs. Clark, Fan stumbled and stammered,
said she wanted a dozen calicoes for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
her mother, and to know how they sold eggs
by the yard.</p>

<p>Then catching the mirthful gleam in Will
Chetwood's eyes and seeing the corners of his
lips twitching, she hastily drew back as far as
possible into the shelter of her sun-bonnet, quite
overwhelmed with confusion by the sudden
consciousness of having made a terrible blunder,
her cheeks aflame and her eyes filling with
tears.</p>

<p>"I think it is a yard of calico like that in
your hand, that you want, and the price of
eggs by the dozen, isn't it?" he asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; that's what mother said," Annis
spoke up briskly.</p>

<p>Fan was quite beyond speaking, and kept
her face hidden in her sun-bonnet, and hurried
away the moment her little parcel was handed
her.</p>

<p>Mildred was alone in the sitting-room as they
came in.</p>

<p>"Where's mother?" asked Annis.</p>

<p>"In the parlor, talking to Mr. Lord. You
got the calico, Fan? Here, give it to me."
Then catching sight of the child's face as she
drew near, "Why, what's the matter? what
have you been crying about?" she asked in a
tone of kindly concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Milly, I couldn't help it! I don't like
to go errands!" cried Fan, bursting into tears
again.</p>

<p>Mildred drew the little weeper to her side,
wiped away the tears, kissed the wet cheek,
and with kindly questioning drew the whole
story from her.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Chetwood was laughing at me, I
know he was! and I don't want ever to go
there any more!" concluded the child, hiding
her burning cheeks on Mildred's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh! you needn't mind that," Mildred said;
"just join in the laugh. That's the way Aunt
Wealthy does; and your mistake is very much
like some of hers."</p>

<p>"Then I don't care so much, for nobody's
nicer than Aunt Wealthy&mdash;unless it's mother
and father and you."</p>

<p>"You needn't except me. I'm by no means
equal to Aunt Wealthy," Mildred said, smiling,
and stroking Fan's hair.</p>

<p>Annis had run into the parlor, and they were
quite alone.</p>

<p>"Milly," said Fan, after a moment's silence,
"I thought God heard our prayers?"</p>

<p>"So he does, Fan."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I mean I thought he would do
what we asked."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not always, because we often ask for something
that he sees would not be good for us.
But what are you thinking about? have you
prayed for something that you didn't get?
Perhaps you expected the answer too soon.
We often have to wait and pray again and
again many times, and at last the answer comes.
And sometimes it comes in a better way than
we had thought of."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Milly," Fan said slowly and
hesitatingly, "I prayed that Mrs. Clark
mightn't be at home; but there she was."</p>

<p>Mildred could scarcely keep from smiling.
"That wasn't a good or right prayer, little
sister," she said, "because&mdash;don't you see?&mdash;it
was selfish, and almost the same as disobeying
mother; since if the prayer had been
granted you would have been prevented from
doing her errand."</p>

<p>"Milly, I didn't think of that," Fan answered
penitently. "I won't pray that way
any more."</p>

<p>"No, dear; a better prayer would be for
help to overcome your foolish timidity. We
will both ask our kind heavenly Father for
that."</p>

<p>We will pass briefly over the events of the
next five years, during which there were few
changes in the Keith family but such as time
must bring to all.</p>

<p>The lines had deepened somewhat on Mr.
Keith's brow and the hair on his temples was
growing gray. The anxieties and burdens of
life pressed more heavily upon him than upon
his lighter-hearted, more trustful wife; she
having learned more fully than he to "lean
hard" upon the Lord, casting all her care upon
him, in the full assurance that he cared for her
and "that all things work together for good to
them that love God;" she looked scarcely a
day older than at the time of Mildred's return
from her visit to Roselands.</p>

<p>These had been years of toil and struggle to
feed, clothe, and educate their large family of
children. They had thus far been successful,
but only by dint of good management, close
economy, and hard work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert had completed his college course and
gone into the drug business in connection with
Dr. Grange.</p>

<p>It was a great joy to Mildred that her earnings
as music teacher had assisted largely in
paying the expense of her brother's education.
Rupert found it hard to consent to this, but
finally did so with the distinct understanding
that he was to repay the money with interest.
"The sisterly kindness," he said, "I can never
repay."</p>

<p>"Yes," Mildred returned, with an arch look
and smile, "you can; by showing, in like manner,
brotherly kindness to Cyril and Don."</p>

<p>"As I certainly hope to do," Rupert responded
with hearty good-will.</p>

<p>And now he and Mildred were pleasing
themselves with the thought that the worst of
the struggle was over. Zillah and Ada were
done with school, though still pursuing some
studies with Mildred at home; it had been decided
that Fan and Annis could and should be
entirely educated by the older sisters; and so
Cyril and Don were the only ones whose tuition
would still be an item of expense to the
parents&mdash;an expense of which the good daughter
and son each hoped to bear a part.</p>

<p>Rupert would be able to do so after awhile&mdash;"by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
the time the lads were ready for college"&mdash;and
Mildred could assist now; as she
was still teaching, and finding it more profitable
than ever.</p>

<p>It sometimes seemed weary work, but she
would not give it up; indeed, the joy of helping
to bear the burdens of the dear father and
mother far more than repaid her for her self-denying
toil.</p>

<p>The town had grown very much, and one of
the new-comers was a music teacher; but Mildred
had established a good reputation, and had
always as many pupils as she cared to take.</p>

<p>In all these years she had heard not a word
from Charlie Landreth; yet her heart remained
true to him.</p>

<p>She did not seclude herself from society, but
generally took part in the innocent pastimes
of the young people of her own station, and
was always cheerful and pleasant, not seldom
even gay and lively; now and then she accepted
the escort of one or another of her gentlemen
friends, but she would not receive particular
attentions from any. Still one or two had
determinately sought her hand in marriage, but
only to meet with a gentle yet firm rejection.</p>

<p>Wallace Ormsby still continued on the most
friendly terms of intimacy in the family, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
after two years had passed without news of his
favored rival, ventured to renew his suit. The
result of this effort convinced him of the utter
hopelessness of ever winning the coveted prize.
He grieved over this second disappointment
for a time, but of late had begun to turn his
longing eyes in a new direction, and Mildred
perceived it with pleasure.</p>

<p>Wallace had been taken into partnership
with Mr. Keith, and she would gladly welcome
him into the family, for she had, as she had
said, a truly sisterly affection for him.</p>

<p>Zillah and Ada were budding into very
lovely womanhood. Of the two, Zillah was the
more strikingly handsome and the more
sprightly; full of innocent mirth and gayety,
witty and quick at repartee, she was the life of
every company of which she formed a part.</p>

<p>Ada's manner was more quiet and reserved,
but suited well with her intellectual countenance
and the noble contour of her features.
They were inseparable, and whenever opportunity
offered Wallace Ormsby was sure to be
with them.</p>

<p>Speculation was rife among the gossips of
the town as to which "he was courting," or
whether it might be that he was in love with
both. Mildred, with her better opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
for observation, and vision sharpened by keen
sisterly affection, presently settled that question
in her own mind, and satisfied herself that
in this instance the course of true love was
likely to run smooth.</p>

<p>The little coterie of which Mildred and
Wallace had formed a part was broken up&mdash;the
other four having paired off for life; it
was known now that Claudina Chetwood was
engaged to Yorke Mocker, and Lucilla Grange
to Will Chetwood.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon for the meeting of the
ladies' sewing society. They were preparing
a box of clothing for a Western home missionary.
The whole Keith family took a deep interest
in the good work; each one had contributed
toward it; the three older girls were
at the meeting, busily plying their needles,
while at home the mother was finishing a garment,
the two little girls sitting beside her
hemming towels: all for the box.</p>

<p>Indeed, the interest was very general in the
church, and there was a goodly gathering of
ladies in Mrs. Prior's parlor, where the society
held its meeting this week. The room was
large and the busy workers had grouped themselves
together here and there as inclination
dictated: Mildred, Claudina, and Lu forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
one group; Zillah, Ada, and several of their
young companions another; while a third was
composed of older ladies.</p>

<p>The three heads in the first group were very
close together, the three voices conversing
earnestly in tones too subdued to give any of
the others an inkling of the subject of their
talk. But there were wise surmises.</p>

<p>"I reckon they're planning for the weddings,"
whispered one elderly lady to her next
neighbor, indicating by a motion of the head
whom she meant.</p>

<p>"Likely," was the rejoinder. "Do you
know when they're to come off?"</p>

<p>"No; but before long, I guess. I don't see
that there's anything to wait for."</p>

<p>"Unless for Mildred and Wallace Ormsby
to make it up together, so that the whole six
can pair off at once and so make a triple wedding.
It would be a novel and pretty idea,
now wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I used to think that would be a
match, but I've changed my mind. It's plain
to be seen now that it's one of the younger
sisters he's after."</p>

<p>"Mildred's young enough; doesn't look a day
over twenty, though I suppose she's really
twenty-three or four."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"About that, I suppose; but she could easily
pass for eighteen. I wonder if she's made up
her mind to be an old maid. If I can read
the signs Wallace was deeply in love with her
at one time; and it's said she's had other
offers."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it; she's too charming to
have escaped that, if the young men have any
taste. Yet she's not so handsome, after all, as
Zillah. I wonder why she wouldn't have Wallace;
he's fine-looking, and an excellent match
every way."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she left her heart in the South.
I've thought I could see a change in her ever
since her visit there. Well, I don't believe her
mother's in any hurry to have her marry and
leave, for there never was a better daughter or
sister. I've heard Mrs. Keith say more than
once that she didn't know how she could ever
do without Mildred."</p>

<p>"And she may well say so," joined in Mrs.
Prior; "the other two are uncommon nice
girls, but Mildred bears off the palm to my
thinking. I hear folks wondering now and
then how it is that Mr. Lord has lived single
all these years. I don't profess to know anything
for certain about it, but I've strong suspicions
that he's tried for Mildred Keith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
couldn't get her, and can't be content to take
anybody else."</p>

<p>"She seems cut out for a minister's wife,"
remarked one of the others.</p>

<p>"Yes; she'd make a good one, I don't
doubt," assented Mrs. Prior; "but I don't
blame her for refusing him (if she has done it);
it's a kind of a hard life, and he's too old for
her and too absented-minded and odd."</p>

<p>The girls&mdash;Mildred and her mates&mdash;were
talking over the arrangements for the approaching
nuptials. The young men wanted
a double wedding and the girls were not averse
to the idea, but the parents of each wanted to
see their own daughter married beneath their
own roof.</p>

<p>"My father says the ceremony ought to be
performed in his house, since one of the contracting
parties in each case is his child," said
Claudina; "but Dr. Grange can't see the force
of the argument."</p>

<p>"No," said Lu, "both he and mother say
that it is always at the house of the bride's
parents the ceremony should be performed."</p>

<p>"Can't you compromise by having it in the
church?" asked Mildred.</p>

<p>"That is what we'll have to do, I presume,"
said Claudina, "if we are to have a double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
wedding. And O Mildred! if you and Wallace
would only make up a match and let us
have a triple one, I think it would be just
splendid."</p>

<p>"And so do I," chimed in Lu. "Now
what's to hinder?"</p>

<p>"A good deal," replied Mildred with a
smile and a blush. "I doubt if it wouldn't
make three or four people unhappy for
life."</p>

<p>"What can you mean! I've been perfectly
sure for years past that Wallace adored you,"
was Claudina's surprised exclamation.</p>

<p>Mildred's only reply was a quiet smile.</p>

<p>"And I dare say he must have popped the
question before this," Claudina went on teasingly;
"so now do be good and obliging
enough to fall in with my plan, for it's a capital
one. Isn't it, Lu?"</p>

<p>"Oh! just lovely," was the eager rejoinder.
"Mildred, do; that's a dear!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, girls," Mildred said, her eyes dancing
with merriment, "I do like to oblige, but
in this instance it is beyond the bounds of possibility.
Whatever you may think, Wallace
does not want me, nor I him."</p>

<p>"Well, then, all I have to say is that neither
of you has good taste. And I'd set my heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
on the match," Claudina said in pretended indignation.</p>

<p>Meantime the younger girls were chatting
gayly among themselves, flitting lightly from
one theme to another&mdash;school affairs, pleasure
parties, dress, and beaux; teasing each other
about the latter, as young girls will.</p>

<p>Zillah and Ada came in for their share.
"Which of them was Wallace Ormsby courting?"
they were asked.</p>

<p>"Probably both," Ada answered in a tone
of irony. "He is a man of original ideas, and
doesn't always do things by rule."</p>

<p>"And he knows we can't live apart," added
Zillah, blushing and smiling.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! he can't marry you both. Now
which of you is it?"</p>

<p>"Suppose you ask him," returned Zillah, the
color deepening still more on her cheek.</p>

<p>"I declare I've a great mind to! I believe
I'll do it to-night, if I get a chance," returned
her tormentor laughingly.</p>

<p>It was the custom for the ladies to come to
the society as early in the afternoon as practicable,
stay to a plain tea and until nine or ten
o'clock in the evening, the gentlemen joining
them for the last hour or two&mdash;an arrangement
which served the double purpose of interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the latter in the good work in a way to draw
forth their contributions, and to provide escorts
for the ladies on their homeward walk.</p>

<p>There was a full attendance that evening.
Among the early arrivals came Nicholas Ransquattle,
bowing low, right and left, as he entered
the room. "Good-evening, ladies. I'm
happy to see you all." Then straightening
himself and throwing back his head (now
grown very bald) upon his shoulders in the
old, awkward fashion, he sent his dull gray
eyes searchingly about the room.</p>

<p>"He's looking for you," Zillah's next neighbor
whispered in her ear. "I heard the other
day that he said down town, talking with some
of the fellows, that he was going to cut Wallace
Ormsby out. And there, just see! he's
making straight for this corner. You ought
to feel proud of your conquest, Zil."</p>

<p>"Not till I'm sure I've made it, Sallie; no,
not even then," Zillah returned somewhat
scornfully; "since I should be but one among
the multitude of his adorable angels."</p>

<p>Sallie laughed and nodded assent, as Nicholas
drew up a chair and seated himself between
them.</p>

<p>It was the common report that he had
courted every girl of marriageable age in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
town, offering heart and hand to each in succession
as they moved into the place or grew
to young maidenhood. No one had accepted
him yet; he had never been attractive to the
softer sex, and did not become more so with
advancing years. Behind his back the girls
were unsparing in their ridicule of his awkward
carriage, homely features, and unbounded
vanity and self-conceit. They had dubbed
him "Old Nick" and "The Bald Eagle."</p>

<p>"Permit your humble servant to be a thorn
between two roses, ladies," he said with another
low bow as he seated himself.</p>

<p>"Provided you are a useful one, Mr. Ransquattle,"
replied Sallie, giving him a needle
to thread. "They are of use sometimes, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Rush, to protect the roses, which
I shall be most happy to do."</p>

<p>"Protect them from what?" asked Zillah
dryly.</p>

<p>"From rude and careless hands that would
fain pluck them from the parent stem; perchance
only to cast them neglectfully aside and
let them die." And Nicholas glanced significantly
toward Ormsby, who had entered the
room at that moment, and was bidding "Good-evening"
to their hostess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>Wallace caught the glance, noted by whom
Ransquattle was seated, and flushed angrily.</p>

<p>"Roses must die whether plucked or not,"
remarked Sallie, "and the fingers that pluck
them save them from wasting their sweetness
on the desert air."</p>

<p>"You'll never be left to so sad a fate, Miss
Rush," was the gallant rejoinder.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied, laughing and
shaking her head, "there may be some danger
if the thorns are too close when the gatherer
of roses comes."</p>

<p>Wallace had found a seat near Mildred, and
she noticed that as he talked with her he stole
many a furtive and ill-pleased glance in Zillah's
direction.</p>

<p>Mildred was folding up her work.</p>

<p>"You are not going yet," he said. "It
wants a full half hour of the usual time for
dispersing."</p>

<p>"I know, but Mrs. Smith is very sick, and
I have promised to watch with her to-night."</p>

<p>"Milly, I'm going home," Ada said, coming
up at that instant. "Mother will be lonely,
perhaps, and I can work just as well there as
here."</p>

<p>"But I must go now, and we must not leave
Zillah to go home alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, but Ru will be here directly I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me have the pleasure of escorting you
both, and I'll come back for Zillah," said Wallace,
speaking hastily in an undertone.</p>

<p>His offer was accepted, and the three slipped
quietly away. Mrs. Smith's house was the
nearer, and not much out of the way in going
to Mr. Keith's; so Mildred was seen to her
destination first, then Wallace and Ada walked
on to hers.</p>

<p>Wallace expected to leave her at the door,
and returning in good season, ask the privilege
of seeing Zillah safely home also; but Mr.
Keith called him in, saying he had an important
matter to consult him about, and in spite
of the young man's ill-concealed impatience to
be gone, kept him there for more than an
hour.</p>

<p>In the mean time Ransquattle made good
use of his opportunity; managing so that, to
Zillah's extreme vexation, she could not reject
his offered escort without great rudeness.</p>

<p>"Forewarned, forearmed," she said to herself,
thinking of Sallie's gossip as they set out:
"'twill go hard with me, but I'll prevent his
getting his opportunity to-night;" and she rattled
on in the liveliest strain without an instant's
intermission, talking the most absurd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
nonsense just to prevent her companion from
opening his lips.</p>

<p>They had reached her father's gate before
he succeeded in doing so. She had no notion
of asking him in.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mr. Ransquattle," she said
gayly, letting go his arm and stepping hastily
inside as he held the gate open for her. "I'm
much obliged for your trouble."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Miss Zillah, for detaining you
a moment, but I have something very particular
to tell you," he said, hardly waiting for the
end of her sentence. "You are a very lovely
and charming young lady."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's no news! I've heard it dozens
of times," she interrupted, laughing and taking
a backward step as if on the point of running
away.</p>

<p>"No doubt; but never, I am sure, from so
devoted an admirer as your humble servant.
Miss Zillah, I lay my heart, hand, and fortune
at your feet."</p>

<p>"Oh don't Mr. Ransquattle," she interrupted
again, half-recoiling as she spoke; "it's
a dangerous place to lay articles so valuable,
lest perchance they should be accidentally trodden
on."</p>

<p>"Can you have misunderstood me?" he
asked, as it would seem in some surprise at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
obtuseness. "I meant to ask you to marry
me. Will you? But don't answer now.
Take time to consider, and I will call to-morrow
to learn my fate from the sweetest lips in
the world."</p>

<p>He was bowing an adieu; but now she detained
him. Drawing herself up with dignity,
and speaking in a calm, cold tone of firm determination,
"No, do not call, Mr. Ransquattle,"
she said: "I need no time to consider the
question you have asked, and will give you
your answer now. I can never bestow my
heart upon you, and therefore never my hand.
Good-night, sir;" and turning, she hastened
with a quick, light step toward the house.</p>

<p>In the hall she met Wallace, who had just
left her father in the sitting-room busy over
some law papers.</p>

<p>"Zillah!" he exclaimed, "what is it? what
has happened?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask? why do you think anything
has happened?" she returned, half averting
her face.</p>

<p>"Because you look so flushed and indignant.
If anybody has been insulting you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O Wallace, what nonsense!" she cried,
with a little nervous laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad if it is not so," he said. "I
hope no one would dare. I meant to go back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
to the society directly, hoping to have the
pleasure of seeing you home, but was unavoidably
detained. It's early yet though, and such
a lovely moonlight evening. Won't you take
a little stroll with me?"</p>

<p>"If you'll wait a moment till I tell mother
we're going."</p>

<p>Mildred, finding she was not needed at Mrs.
Smith's, had returned home and was just
ready for bed; had blown out her candle and
was standing by the window gazing out and
thinking how lovely everything looked in the
moonlight, when her door opened softly and
the next instant Zillah's arms were about her
neck, her face half hidden on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"How you tremble!" Mildred said, putting
an arm around the slender waist; "has anything
gone wrong?"</p>

<p>"O Milly, such a funny time as I've had in
the last hour or two!" and the eyes that looked
up into Mildred's face were fairly dancing
with merriment. "I seem destined to play
second fiddle to you, so far as the admiration
of the other sex is concerned; having actually
received proposals of marriage from two of
your old beaux in this one evening."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Well, I hope you did not accept
both," Mildred said laughingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not both, but one," she whispered with a
low, joyous laugh, and a blush that was visible
even in the moonlight. "O Milly, I'm so
happy! I don't care if I am taking what you
refused. Wallace is far beyond my deserts,
and I wouldn't exchange him for a king."</p>

<p>"Wallace! O Zillah, how glad I am! I
need no longer feel remorseful for having
wrecked his happiness, and shall rejoice to call
him brother: he will be one to be proud of."</p>

<p>"Yes; I am obliged to you for rejecting
him; and I dare say so is he now," she added
saucily, her eyes again dancing with fun.</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it. And now perhaps
there'll be a triple wedding after all."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" returned
Zillah in astonishment; "'tisn't time to be
thinking of weddings yet."</p>

<p>"It would be too soon," Mildred said, and
went on to explain the occasion of her remark;
then said, "But you haven't told me whose was
the other offer."</p>

<p>"Oh, can't you guess?" laughed Zillah;
"don't you know that the Bald Eagle is still
in quest of a mate?"</p>

<p>"Old Nick was it? Now then you must just
tell the whole story," Mildred said in a tone of
amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Twas quite a variation from his offer to
you," Zillah answered mirthfully, and went on
to give a detailed and amusing account of the
walk home and the short colloquy at the gate.</p>

<p>Then bidding good-night she hastened to
her own room, shared with Ada, and repeated
the story to her, winding up with, "Your turn
will come, you may depend upon that; so try
to be prepared."</p>

<p>"Small need of preparation," was the cool
rejoinder. "But you've had a walk with
Wallace since. Won't you tell me what he
said."</p>

<p>"I couldn't begin to remember it all, but&mdash;Ada,
darling, can you spare me to him?"</p>

<p>The last words were spoken in a tremulous
half-whisper, her arm about her sister's
neck, her lips close to her ear.</p>

<p>"I knew 'twould come to that before long!"
sighed Ada, with a hug and a kiss, while
tears sprang to her eyes. "O Zillah, dear, I
believe my happiest days are over and gone!"</p>

<p>"No! No! no, darling! the very, very
sweetest are yet to come! Love will be yours
some day as it is mine to-night; and</p>

<p>Wallace Ormsby sought and obtained a
second interview with Mr. Keith that evening,
in which he asked his senior partner to take
him into still closer relations, and bestow upon
him a priceless gift.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith was both surprised and moved.
"I can't realize that she's really grown up," he
said, "and&mdash;I&mdash;don't know how to spare her
even to you, Wallace."</p>

<p>"But you know, my dear sir, it isn't as if I
wanted to carry her away."</p>

<p>"No, that's quite true. But her mother's
right in her is fully equal to mine. Wait a
moment till I call her in."</p>

<p>So the request and the arguments in its favor
had to be repeated.</p>

<p>The mother's eyes filled, and for a moment
she was silent. Then, holding out her hand to
the young man, "I have long had a motherly
affection for you, Wallace," she said, "and
there is no one else to whom I could so willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
entrust the happiness of my dear child,
and yet it is very hard to give her up."</p>

<p>"Don't think of it in that way, dear Mrs.
Keith," he made answer in tones of the deepest
respect, taking the hand and lifting it gallantly
to his lips. "Think of it rather as
taking another member, another son, into the
family. It would be joy to me to have the
right to call you mother."</p>

<p>"And I should be proud to own you as my
son," she returned with her own sweet, motherly
smile. "But Zillah herself must decide
this question."</p>

<p>"Then I have nothing to fear, nothing more
to ask," he said joyously.</p>

<p>In truth, no one had any objection to bring
against the match, and all went smoothly and
happily with the newly affianced pair.</p>

<p>The next day Wallace came hurrying in
with beaming countenance and eager air. "Ah!
it was you I wanted," he said, finding his betrothed
alone in the parlor, whither she had
betaken herself for her daily hour of practice
on the piano. "Won't you put on a shawl and
bonnet and come with me?"</p>

<p>"Where?" she asked with a merry twinkle
in her eye.</p>

<p>"Just across the street to look at that house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of Miller's. It's nearly finished, and he's willing
to sell."</p>

<p>"But who wants to buy?" she asked in her
pretty, saucy way, as she stepped into the hall
and tied on a bonnet which she took from the
hat-rack there, while Wallace threw a shawl
about her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can better answer that question
after we've been over it," he said with a
smile.</p>

<p>So it proved; the snug, pretty, conveniently
arranged cottage&mdash;so close to the old home
too&mdash;seemed just the thing for them. "Father,
mother," and all the family were presently
brought over to look at and pronounce an
opinion upon it, and without a dissenting voice
the purchase was decided upon.</p>

<p>"And now there's another and still more
important matter to be settled," whispered
Wallace in Zillah's ear.</p>

<p>"There is no hurry," she answered, blushing.</p>

<p>"There is to be a double or a triple wedding
in our church in about a month from now," he
went on lightly and in coaxing tones. "I want
it to be the latter; so do four other people;
but it all depends on you. Come, darling, why
should we wait longer than that?"</p>

<p>"Ah! it fairly frightens me to think of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
haste," she said, half averting her blushing
face.</p>

<p>"I don't know why it should," he responded,
his tone speaking both disappointment and
chagrin, "unless you fear to trust your happiness
to my keeping."</p>

<p>"That's because men are so different from
women; but to save a quarrel&mdash;we'll leave it
to father's and mother's decision; shan't we?"</p>

<p>And she turned to him again with a smile
so arch and sweet that he consented at once,
and sealed the promise with a kiss.</p>

<p>Father and mother said, "Wait at least until
next spring; you are both young enough, and
we cannot part so suddenly with our dear
child."</p>

<p>"Hardly a parting&mdash;just to let her cross the
street," Wallace made answer with a sigh that
was not altogether of resignation; then added
a hint that he would be willing to leave her in
her father's house until spring if only they
would let him join her there.</p>

<p>But that proposal was smilingly rejected, and
the wedding day indefinitely postponed until
"some time in the spring."</p>

<p>Intimate friends were not kept in ignorance
of the engagement, and the two expectant
brides and bridegrooms were, until convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
of its uselessness, very urgent for the triple
wedding.</p>

<p>The double one took place at the appointed
time and place, was quite a brilliant affair, and
followed by a round of festivities such as the
quiet little town had never witnessed before.
Evening entertainments were given by the
Chetwoods, the Granges, the Keiths, and one
or two others. Then life settled back into
the ordinary grooves, and the rest of the fall
and winter passed without any unusual excitement.</p>

<p>The Keiths were quietly, cheerfully busy, as
at other times. Wallace came and went as before,
but was oftener left to Zillah's sole entertainment,
yet treated more entirely than ever
as one of the family.</p>

<p>Brighter days were dawning for our friends.
Through all these years they had been very
diligent in business and very faithful in paying
tithes of all they possessed, and the truth
of Scripture declarations and promises&mdash;"the
hand of the diligent maketh rich," and "so
shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy
presses burst out with new wine"&mdash;was being
verified in their experience. This fall Messrs.
Keith &amp; Ormsby found themselves successful
in several very important cases, which brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
them both fame and money; the town was now
growing rapidly, business looking up, and land,
which they had bought for a trifle on first
coming to the place, had already doubled and
trebled in value.</p>

<p>Rupert, too, was succeeding well in his
chosen vocation, and both he and his father
urged Mildred to cease her toil as a music
teacher, saying there was now not the slightest
necessity for such exertion on her part.</p>

<p>The mother's views coincided with theirs,
but Mildred begged to be permitted to go on
in the old way, saying constant employment
was good for her; she was used to it and
liked it.</p>

<p>"And besides," she added playfully, "I enjoy
the thought that I am laying a little something
by against old age or a rainy day. I am
not likely ever to marry, so will do well to be
self-helpful; and why should I not have a business
the same as if I were a man? I shall be
all the happier, the more useful, and the more
independent."</p>

<p>So they let her have her way. She was not
keeping employment from those who needed
it, for there were plenty of pupils for all the
teachers in the place. Effie Prescott was now
one of these&mdash;most faithful and successful, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
full of joy and thankfulness that thus she was
able to win her bread; for she had not strength
to do so in any more laborious way, and her
father was poor enough to feel it a relief to
have Effie supporting herself.</p>

<p>"And I have you to thank for it," she had
said again and again to Mildred; "it is one of
your good works, and I shall never cease to be
grateful to you for it."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Effie, you owe me nothing," Mildred
would reply; "not even gratitude, for
you have paid well for all I have done for you.
You owe it all, under God, to your own industry,
energy, and perseverance in the use and
improvement of the talents he has given you."</p>

<p>To the whole household at Mr. Keith's the
all-absorbing interest was the fitting up and
furnishing of the snug cottage across the street,
and the preparation of Zillah's trousseau, in
the expense or labor of which each one was
determined to have a share.</p>

<p>All these matters were freely discussed in
the family, even the little boys and girls being
deemed worthy to be trusted not to speak of
them to outsiders. Not that any one felt that
there was any special cause for concealment of
their plans or doings, but they did not wish to
have them canvassed and commented upon by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the busybodies and gossips of the town, who,
like those of other places, always knew so
much more of their neighbors' affairs than did
those neighbors themselves.</p>

<p>No one rejoiced more sincerely than Mildred
in the evident happiness of the affianced
pair; no one entered more heartily into their
plans, was oftener consulted in regard to them,
or was more generous with money and labor
in carrying them out. Her sisterly pride in
Zillah's beauty was without a touch of envy or
jealousy, though she was fully aware of the
fact that it far exceeded her own.</p>

<p>"What a lovely bride she will make!" Mildred
often whispered to herself. "Wallace
may well feel consoled for my rejection of his
suit."</p>

<p>She tried hard for perfect unselfishness, and
to entirely fill her mind and heart with the
interests of the hour, especially as affecting
these two; but thoughts of the love that now
seemed lost to her, of the dreams of happiness
which had been for years gradually fading till
there was scarcely a vestige of them left, would
at times intrude themselves, filling her with
a sadness she could scarce conceal from the
watchful eyes of the tender mother who knew
and so fully sympathized in the sorrows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
anxieties of this her first-born and dearly beloved
child.</p>

<p>She knew that even yet there was a constant
longing, a half-unconscious daily looking for of
news of the wanderer as the mail came in, followed
each time by renewed disappointment,
and that often the poor, weary heart grew sick
indeed with hope deferred.</p>

<p>As spring opened, the day for the wedding
drew near, and the preparations for it were
almost completed. Mildred's sadness of heart
increased, until it cost her a constant and often
heroic struggle to maintain her cheerfulness
before others; while at times she could not
refrain from shedding many tears in the privacy
of her own room. One evening her
mother, entering softly, found her weeping.</p>

<p>"My dear, dear child!" she whispered, taking
her in her arms and caressing her tenderly,
"my dear, brave, unselfish girl! you do not
know how your mother loves you!"</p>

<p>"Precious mother!" responded the weeping
girl, hastily wiping away her tears and returning
the caress; "what could I ever do without
your dear love! I am ashamed of my depression;
ashamed that I should yield to it in
this way. Ah, I little deserve to be called
brave!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"It has been a long, hard trial, dear daughter,"
Mrs. Keith said, softly stroking Mildred's
hair, "and you have borne it wonderfully well;
as you could not in your own strength, I well
know."</p>

<p>"No, never! The joy of the Lord has been
my strength, else my heart would have broken
long ago; for oh, this terrible suspense! so
much worse than any certainty could be!"</p>

<p>"I know it, darling," her mother responded
in moved tones; "then would it not be your
wisest course to endeavor to convince yourself
that either utter indifference or death has ended
this for you?"</p>

<p>"Mother, that is not in the power of my
will. That Charlie could prove untrue I cannot
believe, and something tells me that he still
lives."</p>

<p>"Then, dearest, cheer up. Why this increased
sadness of late?"</p>

<p>"I hardly know myself, mother dear; I am
sure my whole heart rejoices in the happiness
of my sister and Wallace; yet somehow the
sight of it seems to deepen my own sorrow by
contrast. I fear it is because I am selfish."</p>

<p>"I cannot think so," her mother said; "so
do not harbor that thought, thus adding to
your distress. Try to cast your care on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
Lord, fully believing the inspired declaration
that 'all things work together for good to them
that love God, to them who are the called according
to his purpose.' He is never for a
moment unmindful of one of his children; he
has a plan for each one, and suffers no real
evil to befall them. 'Rest in the Lord, and
wait patiently for him.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, mother!" Mildred said, smiling
through her tears, "I am more and more convinced
that all I need to make me perfectly
happy is strong, unwavering faith in the wisdom
and love of my heavenly Father; then I
should rejoice to do and suffer all his holy will,
never doubting that what he sends is the very
best for me."</p>

<p>There was an additional cause for Mildred's
depression just at this time&mdash;one felt in greater
or less degree by all the Keiths&mdash;in the thought
that this was the beginning of the inevitable
breaking up of the dear family circle&mdash;the
forming by one of their number of new ties,
which must in some measure supplant the old&mdash;the
tender loves of parents and children,
brothers and sisters. Zillah was not going far
away, and they did not fear to trust her to Wallace;
but their home would no longer be hers,
and another, in whose veins ran no drop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
their blood, would henceforth be nearer and
dearer to her than they.</p>

<p>Except the parents, perhaps no other felt
this quite so keenly as Ada&mdash;the nearest in
age and hitherto the room-mate and almost inseparable
companion of the sister who was
leaving them.</p>

<p>It was the morning of the wedding day; the
ceremony was to take place in the evening, in
the parlor of Mr. Keith's house, which the sisters
were busily decorating for the occasion with
spring flowers from the garden and the woods.</p>

<p>The supply was not sufficient, and the little
boys were sent in search of more; the mother
and Celestia Ann&mdash;who still lived with them,
going home occasionally for a few weeks, but
always returning and taking up her duties
there with renewed satisfaction&mdash;were deep in
the mysteries of cake-making and kindred arts;
so when the door-bell rang Ada answered it.</p>

<p>Standing before the open door was a very
pleasant-faced young man, whose dress and
general appearance seemed to bespeak him a
clergyman. He lifted his hat with a low bow,
his face lighting up with a smile of recognition.</p>

<p>"Miss Mildred?" he said half inquiringly,
as he held out his hand in cordial greeting.</p>

<p>"No, sir," returned Ada, giving him her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
hand, but with a slightly puzzled look; "I am
Ada Keith."</p>

<p>"Ah! one of the little ones when I knew
you&mdash;not old enough to remember me, I fear.
I am from Lansdale, your old Ohio home."</p>

<p>He handed her a card, on which she read at
a glance, "Rev. Francis Osborne."</p>

<p>"Ah, I know now who you are! I have a
slight remembrance of a big boy of that name
who has had time enough to grow into a man,"
she said with an arch smile that he thought
very bewitching. "Come in, Mr. Osborne;
they will all be glad to see you."</p>

<p>He was warmly welcomed and hospitably
entertained, as an old-time friend, as one coming
from the early home still held in tender
remembrance, and as a messenger from Aunt
Wealthy, who sent by him a handsome bridal
gift&mdash;a beautiful gold brooch. Quite unexpected;
for the dear old lady had already given
generously toward the house-furnishing.</p>

<p>Zillah was greatly pleased. There was already
upon a side-table in the sitting-room
quite an array of handsome presents from her
near relatives and friends&mdash;the Dinsmore cousins
and others&mdash;and Aunt Wealthy's gift was
now assigned a conspicuous place among them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith's wedding dress of rich, white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
silk, her bridal veil and orange blossoms, had
been carefully preserved, and finding that the
dress exactly fitted her, Zillah had chosen to
be married in it, in decided preference to having
a new one.</p>

<p>It was, of course, made in very old-fashioned
style, but she insisted that she liked it all the
better for that, and no one who saw her in it
could deny that it was extremely becoming.</p>

<p>All the sisters were to be bridesmaids&mdash;in
the order of their ages&mdash;and all to wear white
tarlatan. Rupert would be first groomsman;
Robert Grange, a brother of Lu, second; Cyril
and Don, third and fourth.</p>

<p>A large number of guests were invited and a
handsome entertainment was provided. Their
pastor, Mr. Lord, had received due notice of
the coming event, and promised to officiate.</p>

<p>Seeing him leaving the parsonage early in
the afternoon, his mother called to him, asking
where he was going.</p>

<p>"For a walk and to make a pastoral call or
two," he answered, pausing and turning toward
her with an air of affectionate respect.</p>

<p>"Well, Joel, don't forget to come home
early enough to dress for the wedding. I
shall be ready in good season, and hope you
will too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, mother! I'm glad you reminded
me, though, for I really had forgotten
it."</p>

<p>"And will again, I'm very much afraid,"
she murmured, between a smile and a sigh, as
she watched him down the street.</p>

<p>He walked on and on in meditative mood,
till nearing a farm-house, several miles from
town, he was waked from his revery by the
voice of its owner bidding him good-day and
asking if he would go with him to the river
for an afternoon's fishing. "I was just setting
off for it," he said. "I've an extra pole and
line here, and shall be glad of your company."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Vail, I will: it's a pastime
I'm somewhat partial to," the minister made
answer.</p>

<p>"Will, Will!" the farmer called to his son,
"bring me that other fishing tackle, and tell
your mother we'll be back&mdash;Mr. Lord and I&mdash;for
tea about sundown."</p>

<p>Seven was the hour set for the wedding
ceremony. At half-past five Mrs. Lord's tea-table
was ready and waiting for the return of
her son. But six o'clock came, and there was
no sign of his approach.</p>

<p>"I'll go and dress; perhaps he'll be here by
that time," she said to herself, turning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the window from which she had been gazing
with constantly increasing anxiety and impatience.</p>

<p>She made a hasty toilet, hoping every moment
to hear his step and voice. But he came
not. She ate her supper, watched the clock
until the hands pointed to five minutes of
seven; then, filled with vexation and chagrin,
donned bonnet and shawl and set off in haste
for Mr. Keith's.</p>

<p>That gentleman met her at the gate. "Ah,
my dear madam, I am glad to see you!" he
said, shaking hands with her. "Walk in. But
where is Mr. Lord? The guests are all assembled&mdash;now
that you are here&mdash;and everything
is in readiness for the ceremony."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Keith, I'm terribly mortified!"
the old lady burst out, flushing like a girl; "it's
just Joel's absent-mindedness. He meant to
be here in season, I know; but he walked out
some hours since, and where he is now, or
when he will remember to come back, I <em>don't</em>
know. Please don't wait for him another minute,
if you can get anybody to take his place."</p>

<p>"Fortunately we can," said Mr. Keith; "so
please, my dear madam, do not feel disturbed
about that."</p>

<p>He led her into the house, and called Rupert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
and Wallace from the bridal chamber,
where the wedding party were assembled.
Then Frank Osborne was summoned from the
parlor, where, with the other guests, he sat
waiting to witness the coming ceremony. There
was a whispered consultation; then Wallace
hastened to his bride again, and whispered a
word to her, to which she gave a pleased, blushing
assent, as she rose and suffered him to draw
her hand within his arm.</p>

<p>In another minute or two bridegroom and
bride, with the whole train of attendants, had
taken their places in presence of the assembled
guests, and the ceremony began, Frank Osborne
officiating.</p>

<p>He did not seem at all embarrassed or at a
loss for words; his manner was solemn and tender,
and when the ceremony was over every
one said, "How beautiful it was!"</p>

<p>While the bride and groom were receiving
the congratulations of relatives and friends,
Mr. Lord, having leisurely finished his tea, sat
in the farm-house porch, quietly conversing
with his host. But a sudden thought seemed
to strike him, and he started up in evident
perturbation.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Mr. Vail; "anything
gone wrong?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather," groaned the minister, glancing at
the face of his watch, which he had just drawn
from its fob. "I was to have married Wallace
Ormsby and one of Mr. Keith's daughters
about fifteen minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Better get back to town, then, as fast as
you can," returned the farmer, laughing. "I'll
harness up and take you."</p>

<p>"Alas, man, it's already too late!" sighed
the minister.</p>

<p>"'Better late than never,' though, and they
may be waiting for you still."</p>

<p>"Why, yes; that's possible, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"Where shall I take you?" Mr. Vail asked,
half an hour later, as they drove into the town.</p>

<p>"Drive right to Mr. Keith's, if you please."</p>

<p>"I thought maybe you'd want to fix up a
bit, seeing it's a wedding you're going to."</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure! yes, certainly! I'm glad
you reminded me. I'll go home and dress first."</p>

<p>"And while you're at that I'll go round and
tell 'em you're coming&mdash;just to keep 'em from
getting quite out of heart, you know."</p>

<p>He went, and by the time Mr. Lord's toilet
was completed, returned with the information,
delivered in tones of amusement and with eyes
twinkling with fun: "You've lost the job, sir;
somebody else has tied the knot; but they've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
sent word for you to hurry along and you'll be
in time for the refreshments. So cheer up,
for that's the main thing, after all, ain't it."</p>

<p>"Really I&mdash;I'm ashamed to go now," stammered
the minister, looking much mortified
and embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, man! better treat it as a good
joke," returned the farmer gayly.</p>

<p>"I believe you're right," said Mr. Lord, and
proceeded to take the advice.</p>

<p>His apologies and excuses were received
with good-humored raillery, mingled with
laughing assurances that he need not disturb
himself; as things had turned out 'twas all
very well; it seemed a pleasant accident that
had left the performing of the ceremony to an
old and valued friend of the bride and her
family.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. and Mrs. Ormsby
started on their bridal trip&mdash;a visit to his relatives,
to Aunt Wealthy and the old Ohio
home.</p>

<p>Their departure left the house strangely
empty and desolate, to the consciousness of
mother and sisters especially, and Frank Osborne's
advent seemed quite a boon. An old
friend who could tell them much of others
left behind in Ohio, a thorough gentleman,
well educated, refined and polished in manner,
and an earnest, devoted Christian, he proved a
most agreeable companion.</p>

<p>All these years he had fancied himself in
love with Mildred, and it was that, more than
anything else, which had drawn him thither;
yet the first sight of Ada had wholly changed
the direction of his inclination.</p>

<p>He had thought Mildred charming in
younger days, and could not see that she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
lost in attractiveness&mdash;the years seemed rather
to have added to her loveliness; her form was
more finely developed, her countenance sweeter
and more intellectual, while she had lost none
of the freshness and bloom of youth: yet he
found a superior fascination about Ada, and
being of an ardent temperament, open and
frank in disposition, his manner toward her
soon made this apparent to the older members
of the family.</p>

<p>Mildred was perhaps the first to perceive it,
and that without the slightest feeling of envy
or jealousy: she would be glad if Frank proved
to be one who could fill Ada's heart; and if an
objection to the possibility that presented itself
arose in any one's mind, it was merely on the
score of unwillingness to part with another
member of the newly broken family circle.</p>

<p>They had urged Frank to make a lengthened
visit, and he had promised to remain for
some days or a week or two.</p>

<p>He had been but recently licensed to preach,
and was yet without charge. The first Sunday
after his arrival he filled Mr. Lord's pulpit,
by invitation, greatly to the delight and edification
of his hearers. The next week he
preached for a vacant church a few miles
distant from Pleasant Plains, and shortly after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
consented to take charge of it for the next six
months.</p>

<p>A worldly-minded man, seeking wealth and
fame, would have deemed it a most uninviting
field of labor; but Frank Osborne was one of
those who are willing to bear hardness as good
soldiers of Jesus Christ, and whose aspiration
is to win souls rather than earthly riches or
fame. Yet the thought of being near enough
to his old friends for frequent intercourse
may have had its influence also.</p>

<p>The return of the bride and groom after an
absence of some six weeks was a joyful occasion.
They were received in their own cottage
home, which loving hands had set in perfect
order, and rendered beautiful and delightful
with the bloom and perfume of flowers.
When the tender, loving greetings had been
exchanged they made the tour of the house
attended by every member of the family, each
one anxious to witness and have a share in
their pleasure.</p>

<p>The workers had anticipated, as the reward
of their labors, great demonstrations of delight
from Zillah, and were not disappointed; she
seemed to lack words to properly express her
admiration of the effects produced or her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
appreciation of this evidence of their kindness
and love.</p>

<p>Nor was Wallace far behind in bestowing a
like meed of praise and thanks.</p>

<p>The welcoming feast had been prepared and
was partaken of in the house of the parents.
After that Zillah began her housekeeping, enjoying
it exceedingly; for she was no novice
at the business, was defthanded and quick in
her motions, had her mother and older sister
near enough to be consulted at any time; and
utensils, furniture, and the snug cottage itself
were all so new, so fresh and clean.</p>

<p>Then Wallace was pleased with everything
she did, and the work of a family of two
seemed scarce more than play to one used to
the numerous household on the other side of
the street.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of running back and
forth, a constant interchange of good offices.
During the hours that business kept Wallace
at the office, Zillah and Ada were almost sure
to be together in one home or the other.</p>

<p>It was not long before the former discovered
that Frank Osborne was a frequent visitor at
her father's, and began to suspect what was
the particular attraction that drew him thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was not at all displeased at the time, as
things turned out, that Mr. Lord went fishing
on my wedding day and forgot to marry me,
but now I begin to feel quite grateful to him,"
she said teasingly to Ada one day as they sat
alone together, with their sewing, in her own
pretty parlor.</p>

<p>"Why so?" Ada asked, blushing consciously
in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Because in after years it will seem very
fitting that my brother-in-law had the tying of
the knot between Wallace and me."</p>

<p>"That strikes me as very much like counting
your chickens before they are hatched,"
returned Ada demurely. "If you are hinting
at me, please understand that I've always
meant to be the old-maid daughter to stay at
home and take care of the dear father and
mother."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, but folks often miss their vocation.
However, I trust you will not; and I
think you were cut out for a minister's wife.
And O Ada dear," she went on, dropping her
work to put her arms about her sister, "I want
you to know the bliss of wedded love. I never
was so happy in my life as now. And I do
believe Frank is almost as nice as Wallace, or
at least nicer than anybody else except Wallace,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
she corrected herself hastily, and with a
merry laugh; "so don't reject him, there's a
dear."</p>

<p>"Not until he asks," Ada said a trifle disdainfully.
"My promises can go no further
than that at present. I have an idea that he
was formerly one of Mildred's admirers. So
let him try for her; she is far better fitted
than I for the duties and responsibilities of the
position."</p>

<p>"Now don't be naughty and proud," Zillah
said gayly; "you may as well take Mildred's
leavings as I, and I can assure you they may
be very nice indeed. What may have been in
the past," she added more gravely, "I do
not know, but very sure I am that now there
is no fancy on either side."</p>

<p>"A letter for you, Ada!" cried Fan, coming
running in at the open door.</p>

<p>Ada took it quietly and broke the seal.</p>

<p>"Now here's an offer worth having," she
remarked with biting sarcasm, as she turned
the page and glanced at the signature, then
held it so that Zillah could see what it was.
"The bald eagle is still in search of a mate."</p>

<p>"I told you so," was Zillah's laughing rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Lend me an envelope, will you?" Ada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
said, rising with the letter in her hand, a look
of quiet, half-scornful determination in her
face; "and he shall not be kept long waiting
for his answer."</p>

<p>"What shall you say?" Zillah asked as she
brought the envelope, pen, and ink.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Silence cannot be construed to
mean consent in this instance. There, Fan,
please return it to the office," as she sealed the
envelope and handed it to the child; the letter
inside, Nicholas Ransquattle's address on the
outside.</p>

<p>The needles were plied in silence for a few
moments; then Zillah said, with a little amused
laugh, "You made short work with him."</p>

<p>"It seems to be the way of the family," returned
Ada, joining in the laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, only treat Frank as differently as
possible&mdash;that is, with the greatest favor&mdash;and
I'll forgive you for this."</p>

<p>Frank was too wise to speak hastily, therefore
the more likely to win at the last.</p>

<p>One day in the ensuing autumn Mrs. Keith
received a letter from her cousin Horace Dinsmore,
saying that he was travelling with his
little daughter in the region of the Great Lakes,
and could not persuade himself to pass so near
Pleasant Plains without paying her a visit:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
they might be expected in a day or two after
the receipt of this communication.</p>

<p>This news was received with great delight
by the entire family. Mildred's heart bounded
at the thought of again clasping little Elsie in
her arms; for through all these years of separation
the little fair one had been cherished in
her very heart of hearts.</p>

<p>Every preparation was at once set on foot
for entertaining the coming guests in the most
hospitable manner.</p>

<p>There had been an occasional interchange of
letters which had kept each of the two families
informed of any event of unusual importance
occurring in the other. Horace had written
his cousin Marcia on his return from Europe
two years and a half before this, again upon
his recovery from serious illness a year later,
and several times since. In one of his late
letters he had spoken very feelingly of his
child's recovery from an illness that had nearly
cost her life, expressing his gratitude to God
for her restoration to health, and that the trial
had been blessed to himself in leading him to
Christ.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith had loved him from his early
childhood with a sisterly affection, and now
there was a new tie between them; for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
were disciples of the same Master, servants of
the same Lord. And it was in answer to long
continued, fervent supplication on her part
that this priceless blessing had come to him.
What wonder that her heart bounded at the
thought of soon seeing him and little Elsie,
whom she was ready to love almost as she
loved her own offspring, because she was
Horace's child, and because of all that Mildred
had said of her loveliness of character and person.</p>

<p>The letter telling of his conversion had
brought a double delight to both Mildred and
her mother, in the joy a Christian must ever
feel in the salvation of a soul, the consecration
of another heart and life to the service of
Christ, and in the assurance that the darling
Elsie was no longer left to an unsatisfied
hunger for parental love; this the tone of his
letter made very evident; his heart seemed
overflowing with the tenderest fatherly affection;
and indeed he said plainly that her
death would have been worse to him than the
loss of everything else he possessed.</p>

<p>But he did not go into particulars in regard
to the nature or exciting cause of her illness.</p>

<p>On the deck of a steamer rapidly ploughing
her way down Lake Michigan, sat a gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
with a little girl on his knee. His arm encircled
her waist, hers was about his neck. He
was a very handsome man, apparently considerably
under thirty years of age; hardly old
enough, a stranger would judge, to be the
father of the bewitchingly beautiful child he
held, though there seemed a world of fatherly
affection in the clasp of his arm and the tenderness
of his gaze into the sweet face now
resting on his shoulder, while the soft brown
eyes looked out dreamily over the water, now
lifted to his with an expression of confiding
filial love and reverence.</p>

<p>"Papa, I am having a delightful time," she
said, softly stroking his face and beard with
her small white hand.</p>

<p>"I am very glad, my darling, that you enjoy
it so much, and I trust it is doing you good,"
he answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, but I don't need it; I'm as
well as can be now."</p>

<p>"Free from disease, but not yet quite so
strong as papa would like to see you," he said,
with a smile and a tender caress.</p>

<p>"Shall we be long on this boat, papa?"</p>

<p>"Until some time to-morrow morning,
when, if all goes well, we expect to land at
Michigan City, where we will take the stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
for Pleasant Plains, the home of our cousins
the Keiths. Do you remember your Cousin
Mildred?"</p>

<p>"A very little, papa; I don't remember her
looks, except that they were pleasant to me
when she used to take me on her lap and hug
and kiss me."</p>

<p>"Your grandpa wrote me that she was very
kind to you. She is the only one of the family
you have ever met."</p>

<p>"Please tell me about the rest, papa. Are
Cousin Milly's father and mother my uncle
and aunt?"</p>

<p>"You may say Uncle Stuart and Aunt
Marcia to them, though they are really your
cousins. Well, what is it?" seeing a doubtful,
troubled look in the eyes lifted to his.</p>

<p>"Please papa, don't be vexed with me," she
murmured, dropping her eyes and blushing
deeply, "but would it&mdash;be quite&mdash;quite true
and right to call them so when they are not
really?"</p>

<p>He drew her closer and softly kissing the
glowing cheek, "I should prefer to have you
call them aunt and uncle," he said, "and I cannot
see anything wrong or untrue in doing so;
but if it is a question of conscience with you,
my darling, I shall not insist."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, dear papa," she said, looking
up gratefully and drawing a long sigh of relief;
"but I want to do as you wish; please tell me
why you do not think it wrong."</p>

<p>"They may adopt you as their niece, you
them as your uncle and aunt," he answered,
smiling down at the grave, earnest little face.</p>

<p>"What a nice idea, papa!" she exclaimed
with a low, musical laugh, her face growing
bright and glad; "that makes it all right, I
think. I knew about adopted children and
adopted parents, but I didn't think of any
other adopted relations."</p>

<p>"But do you not see that that must follow
as a matter of course?"</p>

<p>A middle-aged colored woman had drawn
near carrying a light shawl. "De air gettin'
little bit cool, I tink, massa," she remarked, in
a respectful tone. "I'se 'fraid my chile cotch
cold."</p>

<p>"Quite right, Aunt Chloe," he returned,
taking the shawl from her and wrapping it
carefully about the little girl.</p>

<p>But he had scarcely done so when a sudden
storm of wind came sweeping down upon the
lake, from the northwest, and drove them into
the cabin.</p>

<p>There were other passengers, but the saloon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
was not crowded, and for a time proved a
pleasant enough retreat. Supper was served
presently and partaken of in tolerable comfort,
though the lake was growing rough, and the
vessel rolling and pitching in a way that made
it a little difficult to keep the dishes on the
table and eat and drink without accident. But,
as they were not supposed to be in danger, the
little mishaps merely gave occasion for mirth
and pleasantry.</p>

<p>But ere long the storm increased in violence,
the wind blowing a gale, accompanied with
thunder, lightning, and torrents of rain. The
faces of men and women grew pale and
anxious, conversation had almost ceased, and
scarce a sound was heard but the war of the
elements mingled with the heavy tread of the
sailors and the hoarse commands of the captain
and mate.</p>

<p>The little girl, seated on a sofa by her
father's side, crept closer to him, with a
whispered, "Papa, is there any danger?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there is, my darling," he said,
putting his arm about her and drawing her
closer still; "but we will trust in Him who
holds the winds and the waters in the hollow
of his hand. I do not need to remind my
little Elsie that no real evil can befall us if
we are his children."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, papa; and oh, how sweet it is to know
that."</p>

<p>"It is your bedtime," he said, glancing at
his watch.</p>

<p>"But you will not send me away from you
to-night, dear papa?" and she looked pleadingly
into his face.</p>

<p>"No, my precious child! no, indeed! not for
all I am worth would I let you out of my sight
in this storm, but I will go with you to your
state-room."</p>

<p>He half led, half carried her, for the vessel
was now plunging so madly through the
water, with such rolls and lurches, that it was
no easy matter for a landsman to keep his feet.</p>

<p>They found Aunt Chloe in the state-room
waiting to disrobe her nursling and prepare
her for her night's rest; but Mr. Dinsmore
dismissed her, saying Elsie should not be
undressed, as there was no knowing what
might occur before morning.</p>

<p>"Don't you undress, either, Aunt Chloe,"
he added, as she kissed the child good-night
and turned to go. "Lie down in your berth
and sleep if you can; but so that you will be
ready to leave it the instant you are called.
Give John the same direction from me, and
tell him to keep near the door of my state-room."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>Left alone with his little girl, he knelt with
her by his side, his arm supporting her while
he commended both her and himself, as well
as the others on the vessel, and dear ones far
away, to the protecting care of Him who
neither slumbers nor sleeps. Then lifting the
child in his arms he held her to his heart for
a moment, caressing her with exceeding tenderness.</p>

<p>"My darling, you shall lie in your father's
arms to-night," he said, as he laid her in the
lower berth and stretched himself by her side.</p>

<p>"That will be so nice," she said, creeping
close and laying her cheek to his; "it would
make me glad of the storm, if I were quite,
quite sure that the boat will get safe into port.
But O papa! if it shouldn't I am so glad that
you are not here without me."</p>

<p>"Why, my pet?"</p>

<p>"Because if you&mdash;if anything happens to
you, I want to be with you and share it. Papa,
papa, don't try to save me if you cannot be
saved too, for I couldn't bear to live without
you!" she concluded with a low cry of mingled
grief, terror, and entreaty, as she clung about
his neck, dropping tears on his face.</p>

<p>"God grant we may not be parted," he
returned, holding her close. "We will cling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
together through whatever comes. But now
dearest, try to go to sleep, fearing nothing, for
you are not only in the arms of your earthly
father, but the Everlasting Arms are underneath
and around both you and me. We have
asked our heavenly Father to take care of us,
and we know that he is the hearer and answerer
of prayer."</p>

<p>"And I'm sure Miss Rose prays for us too,
papa," she whispered, "she loves us so dearly;
and I do believe God will spare us to her.
But if he does not see best to do that, he will
take us to himself, and O dear, dear papa! I
think it would be very sweet for you and me
to go to heaven together!"</p>

<p>"Very sweet indeed, my precious one! very
bitter for either to be left here bereft of the
other. But let us not anticipate evil. Still,"
he added after a moment's thought, "it is right
and wise to be prepared for any event; so, dear
one, should I be lost and you saved, tell Mr.
Travilla I gave you to him; that I want him
to adopt you as his own. I know he will
esteem it the greatest kindness I could possibly
have done him, and will be to you a father
tender, loving, and true; a better one than I
have been." His tones grew husky and tremulous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Papa, papa, don't!" she cried, bursting
into sobs and tears, and clinging to him with
an almost deathlike grasp. "I can't bear it!
I don't want to live without you! I won't! I
will drown too, if you do!"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, darling! do not talk so; that
would not be right; we must never throw
away our lives unless in trying to save others,"
he said, soothing her with the tenderest
caresses. "But there, I didn't mean to distress
you so; and something seems to tell me we
shall both be saved. Let me wipe away your
tears. There, do not cry any more; give papa
another kiss, then lay your head down upon
his breast and go to sleep."</p>

<p>She obeyed; he clasped her close with one
arm, while the other hand was passed caressingly
again and again over her hair and cheek.
Presently her quietude and regular breathing
told him that she slept.</p>

<p>He lay very still that her slumbers might
not be disturbed, but thought was busy in his
brain, thought of the past, the present, the
future; of the fair young girl away in a
distant city, expecting soon to become his
bride; of the beloved child sleeping on his
breast; of the father who regarded him with
such pride and affection as his first-born, "his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
might and the beginning of his strength;" how
would his death affect them in case he were
lost this night? Ah, Rose might console herself
with another lover; his father had other
sons; but Elsie? ah, he was sure his place in
her heart could never be filled; Travilla would
be kind and tender, but&mdash;as she herself had once
said&mdash;he was not her own father and could
never be, even if he gave her to him. What
a precious, loving child she was! how deep and
strong her filial affection! she seemed to have
no memory for past severity on his part (ah,
what would he not give to be able to blot it
from his own remembrance, or rather that it
had never been!), but to dwell with delight
upon every act, word, and look of love he had
ever bestowed upon her. Ah, the bitterness of
death, should it come, would be the parting
from her; the leaving her behind to meet
life's dangers and trials bereft of his protecting
love and care.</p>

<p>But insensibly waking thought merged into
dreams; then his senses were wrapped in profounder
slumber, and at length he awoke to
find that the storm had passed, the sun arisen,
and the vessel was nearing port.</p>

<p>"Thank God, the danger is past!" came in
a low-breathed exclamation from Mr. Dinsmore's
lips. "Ah, my darling, did I wake
you?" as he perceived the soft brown eyes of
his little daughter gazing lovingly into his.</p>

<p>"No, papa dear, I have been awake a good
while, but have not dared to move for fear of

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>They landed in safety, breakfasted at a hotel,
and took the stage for Pleasant Plains; glad
to find they had it to themselves&mdash;they and
their two servants.</p>

<p>It was a lovely October day; the roads were
good, the woods gay with autumn tints, the
sun shone brightly after the rain, and the air
was sweet, pure, and invigorating.</p>

<p>Elsie sat by her father's side gay and happy
as a bird&mdash;chatting, singing, laughing; plying
him with intelligent questions about everything
she saw that was new and strange, and
about the cousins whom they were going to
visit; he answering her with a patient kindness
that never wearied.</p>

<p>He had neglected her in her babyhood, and
once&mdash;only a year ago&mdash;his tyrannical severity
had brought her to the borders of the grave:
he could not forget it; he felt that he could
never fully atone to her for it by any amount
of the tenderest love and care; but she should
have all he could lavish upon her.</p>

<p>A joyous welcome awaited them on their
arrival. Mrs. Keith embraced her cousin with
sisterly, his child with motherly affection, and
Mildred wept for joy as she folded Elsie to her
heart.</p>

<p>Indeed Elsie's beauty, her sweet, loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
looks and smiles as she accepted and returned
their greetings, won all hearts; while all presently
esteemed "Cousin Horace" far more
agreeable and lovable than he had been on his
former visits; there was less of pride and
hauteur about him, more of gentleness and
thought for the comfort and happiness of
others.</p>

<p>Mildred and her mother were especially
delighted with the ardent affection evidently
subsisting between him and his little girl;
neither seemed willing to lose sight of the
other for a single hour; she hovered about
him, being almost always close at his side or
on his knee, he caressing her now and then,
half unconsciously, as he talked, or his hand
toying with her curls.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith remarked upon it to him as they
sat alone together the day after his arrival,
expressing her heartfelt joy in beholding it.</p>

<p>Elsie had just left the room with Annis, her
father's eyes following her as she went, with
the wonted expression of parental pride and
tenderness.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said with a sigh, "she is the very
light of my eyes. Ah, Marcia, I shall never
cease to regret not having followed your advice
on my last visit, by taking immediate possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of my child! I have lost by that mistake
eight years of the joy of fatherhood to the
sweetest child ever parent had. And yet it
has, perhaps, been better for her, for I should
have made her very worldly-minded instead of
the sweet little Christian I found her."</p>

<p>"You have at all events escaped the loss I
feared for you," Mrs. Keith said, with a sympathizing
smile.</p>

<p>"Of her filial love and obedience? Yes, she
could not be more dutiful or affectionate than
she is. And yet there was at one time a terrible
struggle between us; but for which, I
now see, that I alone was to blame. It was
my severity, my determination to enforce
obedience to commands that conflicted with
the dictates of her enlightened conscience,
that caused the almost mortal illness of which
I wrote you. Yes, a year ago I had nearly
been written childless. At one time I thought
she was gone, and never, never can I forget
the unutterable anguish of that hour." His
voice had grown husky, his features worked
with emotion, and tears filled his eyes.</p>

<p>But recovering himself he went on to give
her a somewhat detailed account of the whole
affair, as it is to be found in the Elsie books;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
she listening to the recital with intense, often
tearful interest.</p>

<p>The little girls were in Mildred's room
dressing dolls and chatting together the while,
Mildred, busied with some sewing, overhearing
the most of their talk with both interest and
amusement. Elsie was describing the Oaks
and her home-life there, in reply to inquiries
from Annis.</p>

<p>"What a lovely place it must be! and how
delightful to have a pony of your own and
ride it every day!" exclaimed the latter.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's very nice; but the best of all, I
think, is living in papa's house with him. You
know we used to live at Roselands, with
Grandpa Dinsmore and the rest."</p>

<p>"But I should think you'd often feel lonesome
in that big house with nobody but Cousin
Horace and the servants. Don't you wish
you had a mother like ours and brothers and
sisters?"</p>

<p>A bright, eager, joyous look came into Elsie's
face at that question; she opened her lips
as if to speak, then closed them again. "Oh,
wait a minute till I ask papa something!" she
said, laying down the doll she had in her
hands, and running from the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore was just finishing his sad
story of her illness as the little girl came in.
She heard his last, self-reproachful sentence,
and coming softly to his side, put her arm
about his neck and her lips to his cheek.
"Dear, dear papa, I love you so much!" she
whispered. "Aunt Marcia," turning to Mrs.
Keith, "I think I have the best, kindest father
in the world. He was so, so good to me when
I was sick, and he always is. To be sure, he
punishes me when I'm naughty; but that's
being good to me, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I think so," Mrs. Keith answered with a
smile; then excused herself and left the room
for a moment.</p>

<p>"Papa," said Elsie, taking possession of his
knee, "may I tell my cousins about Miss
Rose?"</p>

<p>"I never forbade you to speak of her, did
I?" he returned, in a playful tone, smiling on
her and stroking her hair with caressing hand.</p>

<p>"No, sir; but I would like to tell them that&mdash;that
she is going to be my mamma soon; if
I may&mdash;if you would like me to?"</p>

<p>"You may tell them; I do not object; but
it was quite right to ask permission first," he
answered; and with a joyful "Thank you,
sir," she skipped away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mrs. Keith rejoined him he had
another story for her ear&mdash;a brighter, cheerier
one than the last; the same that Elsie was
gleefully rehearsing to her cousins up-stairs.</p>

<p>"Miss Rose was so nice, so good, so kind,"
she had been saying.</p>

<p>"Is she pretty too?" asked Annis.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not nearly so beautiful as my own
mamma," Elsie said, drawing from the bosom
of her dress a lovely miniature set in gold and
precious stones.</p>

<p>Annis exclaimed at the extreme beauty of
both the face and its setting, while Mildred
gazed upon the former with eyes full of a
mournful tenderness.</p>

<p>"It's almost prettier than your gold watch,"
Annis said, "though I thought that was as
beautiful as anything could be. Your rings
too."</p>

<p>"They were presents from papa and Mr.
Travilla," said Elsie, glancing down at them,
"and the watch was mamma's. Papa had it
done up for me this summer, and gave me the
chain with it."</p>

<p>"Such a beauty as it is, too! Did you ever
go to school, Elsie?"</p>

<p>"No, we had a governess at Roselands; now
papa teaches me himself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you like that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! He explains everything so
nicely and makes my lessons so interesting.
He often tells me a nice story to illustrate, and
is never satisfied till I understand every word
of my tasks."</p>

<p>"There!" cried Annis looking out of the
window, "Zillah is motioning for me to come
over. Will you come with me, Elsie?"</p>

<p>"If papa gives permission. I'll run and ask
him."</p>

<p>"Why, can't you go across the street without
asking leave?" exclaimed Annis in surprise.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not allowed to go anywhere without
leave."</p>

<p>"Now, that's queer! Your papa pets you
so that I really supposed you could do exactly
as you pleased."</p>

<p>"How Enna would laugh to hear you say
that," returned Elsie, laughing herself. "She
thinks papa is the strictest person she ever
saw, and says she wouldn't be ruled as I am
for any money."</p>

<p>"How do you mean? He seems so fond of
you, and you of him too."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, we're ever so fond of each
other; but papa will always be obeyed the instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
he speaks, and without any teasing, fretting,
crying, or sour looks, and he is sure to
punish the slightest act of disobedience, never
taking forgetfulness of his orders as any excuse."</p>

<p>"Then he is strict," remarked Annis, shrugging
her shoulders.</p>

<p>The two went down-stairs together, Elsie
asked and received the desired permission, and
they hastened to inquire what Zillah wanted.</p>

<p>"I've been baking some jumbles," she said.
"I know Annis is very fond of them hot from
the oven, and I hope you are too, Elsie. And
here is a paper of candy Wallace bought last
night. There, sit down and help yourselves."</p>

<p>Elsie looked a little wishfully at the offered
dainties, but politely declined them. Both
Zillah and Annis urged her to partake, the
latter adding, "I'm sure you can't help liking
them, for nobody makes better jumbles than
Zillah."</p>

<p>"They look very tempting," Elsie answered,
"and I have no doubt are very nice, but I
think they are richer than papa would approve;
and besides he does not allow me to
eat between meals, unless it is some very
simple thing that I will eat only if quite hungry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"But the candy; you can eat some of that,
can't you?"</p>

<p>"No, Cousin Zillah, I must never eat that
unless papa gives it to me himself. Once in a
long while he gives me a very little."</p>

<p>"Dear me! I begin to almost think Enna's
right," Annis said laughingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" cried Elsie, reddening and
the tears starting to her eyes; "papa is very,
very kind to me; he forbids only what he
thinks injurious to my health."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Zillah, "and it shows that
he is a good father; and you are a good
daughter to be so ready to stand up for him
and so obedient."</p>

<p>She went out of the room, leaving the little
girls alone for a short time.</p>

<p>"Annis, here is a note I want Wallace to
have at once," she said, coming back. "Will
you take it to the office for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if Elsie will go with me?"</p>

<p>"I will go and ask papa if I may," Elsie
said, tying on her hat. "Ah, there he is now
coming out of the gate with Aunt Marcia."</p>

<p>She ran to him and preferred her request,
Annis following close behind.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "Aunt Marcia and I are
going to walk down the street, and you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
run on before with Annis. I shall keep you in
sight."</p>

<p>"Are you to wait for an answer, Annis?"
asked her mother.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Then you and Elsie can join us as soon as
you have handed Wallace the note. I am
going to show Cousin Horace a part of the
town he hasn't seen yet. Run on ahead, and
we will meet you at the office door as you
come out."</p>

<p>Eager for the walk with their parents, the
little girls made haste to obey.</p>

<p>"There! my shoe-string is untied," cried
Annis, suddenly stopping short within a few
yards of their destination. "Here, Elsie,
won't you run in with the note while I'm
tying it?"</p>

<p>Elsie obligingly complied.</p>

<p>The door stood open, and stepping in, she
caught sight of a strangely uncouth figure:
that of a man, coatless and hatless, wearing
green goggles, a red flannel shirt with a white
bosom tied on over it, and sitting sidewise in
Mr. Keith's office chair, with his legs over the
arm, dangling in air; a full set of false teeth
twirling about in his fingers, while he gave
vent to the most dismal sighs and groans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>One sweeping glance showed the child that
this was the only occupant of the room, and
springing back in terror, she turned and fled,
flying with swift feet to the shelter of her
father's arms.</p>

<p>He was not far away, and in a moment she
was clinging to him, pale and almost speechless
with fright.</p>

<p>"My darling, what is it?" he asked, stooping
to take her in his arms. "You are trembling
like a leaf. What has alarmed you so?"</p>

<p>"Papa, papa," she gasped, "there's a crazy
man in Uncle Stuart's office."</p>

<p>"Never mind, he shall not hurt you, daughter,"
Mr. Dinsmore answered in soothing
tones.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith and Annis were looking on and
listening in surprise and bewilderment; then
the former, seeing a tall form issuing from the
office door, a coat over one arm, a hat in that
hand, while the other seemed to be employed
in settling his teeth, burst into a laugh, not
loud but very mirthful, saying, "Not a lunatic,
dear, but our very odd and absent-minded
minister."</p>

<p>He was walking away in the direction to
take him farther from them. They saw Wallace
meet him and stop to shake hands and exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
a few sentences. Then the two parted,
Mr. Lord walked on, and Wallace hurried to
meet them.</p>

<p>The thing was soon explained. Mr. Lord
had come in heated by a long walk, and finding
no one in the office, had pulled off his coat
and settled himself to rest and grow cool while
waiting for the return of Mr. Keith or Wallace.</p>

<p>But Elsie, with nerves still weak from her
severe illness, could not recover immediately
from the effects of her sudden fright; she still
trembled and was very pale. So a carriage
was sent for and a drive substituted for the
intended walk; much to the delight of Annis,
to whom it was an unusual treat.</p>

<p>Wallace Ormsby was not behind his wife
in admiration and liking for Frank Osborne;
he enjoyed his sermons, too, and was desirous
that Mr. Dinsmore should hear the young
preacher, and make his acquaintance; therefore
had persuaded him and Mr. Lord to an
exchange of pulpits on the morrow, which was
Sunday, and invited Frank to be his and Zillah's
guest. Wallace was hospitably inclined, and
not a little proud of his young wife's housekeeping.</p>

<p>The invitation was accepted, and the visit
extended a day or two by urgent request. Of
course the time was not all spent on the one
side of the street, and Mr. Dinsmore, who was
not lacking in observation, soon perceived how
matters were tending between Ada and the
young clergyman.</p>

<p>He spoke to his cousin about it, saying that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
"he was pleased with Mr. Osborne, finding
him agreeable, well-informed, and an able sermonizer
for his years; but surely his lack of
means was an objection to the match, or would
be if Ada were his daughter."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "but 'the blessing of the
Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow
with it.' If there is mutual love we will raise
no barrier to their union. But I should greatly
prefer to keep my dear daughter with me
for some years yet."</p>

<p>"Yes; I do not doubt that. I am glad indeed
that it must be many years before I am
called to part with mine to some other man.
But, Marcia, how is it that Mildred is still
single? So sweet and attractive as she is in
every way, it must certainly be her own fault."</p>

<p>In reply Mrs. Keith told him how it had
been between Mildred and Charlie Landreth,
and how six long years had now passed with no
word from or of the wanderer.</p>

<p>He was deeply touched. "It would be well
if she could forget him and bestow her affections
upon another," he said, "for surely if still
living, he is unworthy of her. I knew and
liked him as a boy, but it is long since I have
seen or heard of him. He and his uncle made
a disastrous failure in business, though I understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
that no blame attached to either; then
the uncle died, and Charlie disappeared from
our neighborhood, where nothing has been
heard of him since, so far as I have learned.
But I will make inquiries on my return, and
may possibly be able to trace him. However,
rest assured that I will do nothing to compromise
Mildred," he added, noticing a doubtful
look on his cousin's face.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said, her voice trembling
slightly. "I can trust you, I know, Horace;
and I cannot tell you how glad I should be to
have my dear, patient child relieved of this
torturing suspense."</p>

<p>This visit of their cousins was a grand holiday
for all the younger Keiths, Fan and Annis
more especially; they were excused from
lessons, and had delightful daily walks and
drives.</p>

<p>Every morning Elsie would take her Bible
into her papa's room and spend a little while
there with him, before they were called to
breakfast. He sent her to bed regularly at half
past eight, so that she was ready to rise betimes.</p>

<p>One evening when she came to bid him good-night,
he kissed her several times, saying, "I
shall probably not see you in the morning;
very likely not until to-morrow evening, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
am going hunting with your uncle, and we expect
to start very early."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish little girls could go too!" Elsie
exclaimed, clinging to him. "But mayn't I
get up in time to see you before you go, papa?"</p>

<p>"I don't think you will be awake, daughter.
We start before sunrise."</p>

<p>"But if I am, papa, mayn't I run into your
room and kiss you good-by?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but try not to feel disappointed if
you should miss the opportunity. And don't
shed any tears over papa's absence," he added
half jestingly.</p>

<p>"No, sir; but it will be a long day without
you," she sighed, with her arm about his neck,
her cheek to his.</p>

<p>"I think you will find the time pass much
more rapidly than you expect," he said cheerily;
"but whether or no, you must try to be
bright and pleasant for the sake of those
around you. Don't indulge selfishness, even
in little things, darling."</p>

<p>"I will try not to, papa," she answered, giving
and receiving a final hug and kiss.</p>

<p>No one was near enough at the moment
to observe or overhear what passed between
them, and no one knew anything about the
few quiet tears Elsie shed as she went up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
stairs to her Cousin Mildred's room where she
was to sleep that night. Ada, Fan, and Annis
had all had their turn&mdash;because all wanted
the sweet little cousin for a bed-fellow&mdash;and
now it was Mildred's. But she found her mammy
waiting to prepare her for bed, and her
little trouble was soon forgotten in sound, sweet
sleep.</p>

<p>Mildred came up an hour later, and stepping
softly to the bedside, stood for a minute or two
gazing tenderly down upon the sweet little
sleeping face. Its expression brought to her
mind the lines&mdash;read she could not remember
where&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I want to be marked for thine own&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy seal on my forehead to wear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Dear little girlie," she whispered, bending
over the child, "you wear it if ever mortal did!
No wonder you are the very idol of your father's
heart!"</p>

<p>Half an hour before sunrise Mildred was
again moving quietly about, careful not to disturb
her little room-mate while making a neat,
though rapid toilet.</p>

<p>Going out, she left the door slightly ajar.
Her cousin was just issuing from his, seemingly
in full readiness for his expedition. They exchanged
a pleasant, low-toned good morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not know you were so early a riser,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I claimed the privilege of pouring out the
coffee for you and father," she returned with a
smile. Then pointing to the door, "Go in, if
you like. I know you want to kiss your baby
before you start; she's there asleep."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>He stole softly in and bent over the loved
sleeper for a moment, his eyes devouring the
sweet, fair face; he stooped lower, and his
moustache brushed the round, rosy cheek.</p>

<p>"Papa," she murmured in her sleep; but a
second kiss, upon her lips, awoke her.</p>

<p>Instantly her arm was round his neck. "O
papa, I'm so glad you came! Please, may I
get up and see you start?"</p>

<p>"No; lie still and take another nap, my pet.
We'll be off before you could dress. There,
good-by, darling. Don't expose yourself to the
sun in the heat of the day, or to the evening
air. Though I expect to be back in time to see
to that last."</p>

<p>"I hope so, indeed, papa; but you know I
will obey you just the same if you are not here
to see."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it in the least," he said.</p>

<p>Then the door closed on him, and the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
girl, accustomed to implicit obedience, turned
over and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>When Mildred came up a little before the
usual breakfast hour, she found her dressed and
reading her Bible.</p>

<p>"You love that book, Elsie dear?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, cousin. And I do love to
have my papa read it with me. This is the
first morning he has missed doing so since&mdash;since
I was so very sick." The voice sounded
as if tears were not far off.</p>

<p>"How nice to have such a good, kind
father," Mildred remarked in a cheery tone.</p>

<p>"Oh it is so, cousin!" Elsie answered, her
whole face lighting up. "I used to be continually
longing for papa while he was away in
Europe. I'd never seen him, you know, and
have no mother or brother or sister&mdash;and now
I just want to hold fast to him all the time:&mdash;my
dear, dear papa!"</p>

<p>"And you are missing him now? Well,
dear, take comfort in the thought that he is
probably enjoying himself, and will soon return
to his little pet daughter. I think he
never forgets you&mdash;he asked what we could do
with you to-day in his absence, and I told him
my plan for the morning. He approved, and
now shall I tell it to you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, cousin! if you please," returned
the child with a very interested look.</p>

<p>"Our sewing society meets this afternoon,
and as we&mdash;mother, my sisters, and I&mdash;have
some work to finish before we go, we will have
to be busy with our needles. One generally
reads aloud while the others sew, and we would
like to have you join us; taking your turn at
both sewing and reading, if you choose."</p>

<p>"Very much, cousin, if&mdash;if the book is one
that papa approves; he never allows me to read
anything without being sure of that."</p>

<p>"Ah, that was why he said 'Tell Elsie I say
she may read or listen to anything her Aunt
Marcia pronounces suitable for her.' We have
some very nice books that may be new to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, then I think it will be ever so nice!"</p>

<p>"Well then," said Mildred, "we will take
a short walk soon after breakfast, then spend
the rest of the morning as I have proposed.
Your papa says you can read aloud very nicely,
and use your needle well, too."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you will think so,
cousin," Elsie returned modestly, "but I am
willing to try, and shall do my very best."</p>

<p>They carried out their plans with only a
short interruption from a caller. After dinner
Annis was left to entertain Elsie for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
hours while the others attended the meeting of
the society.</p>

<p>It was an almost sultry afternoon, and Annis
proposed taking the dolls to a grotto her
brothers had made for her and Fan, near the
spring that bubbled up at the foot of the high
river bank, and was reached by a flight of
steps that led down from the garden behind
the house.</p>

<p>The grotto was tastefully adorned with moss,
pebbles, and shells, and had a comfortable rustic
seat, artistically formed of twigs and the
smaller branches of trees with the bark still on
them.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant place to sit and dream on a
summer afternoon, with the clear bright water
of the river lapping the pebbly shore almost
at your feet, the leafy branches of a grape-vine
overhead nearly concealing you from the view
of any one on the further bank or in a passing
boat. A pleasant place, too, for children to
play, and not at all a dangerous one; the little
Keith girls went there whenever they chose.</p>

<p>Elsie and Annis were congenial spirits, enjoyed
each other's society, and had spent an
hour or more very agreeably together in this
cool retreat, when the sound of dipping oars
near at hand drew their attention, and peering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
out from behind the leafy screen of the
grape-vine, they saw a canoe approaching propelled
by the strong young arms of Cyril and
Don, now grown to be lads of sixteen and fourteen.</p>

<p>"Hello! we thought we'd find you here,
girls," Cyril called to them. "Don't you want
to take a row?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, yes indeed!" cried Annis, jumping
up and clapping her hands with delight.
"Come, Elsie, there couldn't be anything nicer,
I'm sure!"</p>

<p>Elsie rose as if to comply, her face full of
eager delight also, but its expression changed
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I ought not, Annis," she said;
"papa might not be willing, and I can't ask
him, you know, because he is away."</p>

<p>The boys had now brought the canoe close
up, and Cyril reached out his hand to help her
in.</p>

<p>"Come, little coz," he said in his most persuasive
tones, "I'm sure your father would not
object; there isn't a particle of danger. I'm
used to rowing on this river, as well as to fishing
and swimming in it&mdash;and it's not deep or
swift, except in mid-current, and I promise to
keep near the shore."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"But papa is very strict and particular," Elsie
said, hanging back, though with a longing
look in her lovely brown eyes.</p>

<p>"But he likes to have you enjoy yourself,
surely?" put in Don.</p>

<p>"Indeed, he does, when it's quite safe and
right," Elsie returned with warmth; "he loves
me dearly."</p>

<p>"Then he wouldn't like you to miss this
pleasure," said Cyril. "The canoe is a borrowed
one, and it isn't every day I can get it."</p>

<p>"And if you don't go I can't," remarked
Annis.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you can," Elsie said; "don't stay
for me. I'll go up to the house and amuse
myself with a book till you come back."</p>

<p>"No, no, I couldn't think of leaving my
company; it wouldn't be at all polite; and I
couldn't enjoy it without you; yet I want to
go ever so much. O Elsie, do come!"</p>

<p>"I want to, I'm sure; both to oblige you,
Annis, and for my own pleasure," Elsie answered.
"Oh I wish I were quite sure papa
would be willing!"</p>

<p>"Take it for granted," said Cyril, "it's the
best you can do, under the circumstances; so
he surely can't be much displeased."</p>

<p>Still Elsie hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," said Cyril, mischievously, "is Cousin
Horace so very severe! Are you afraid he will
whip you?"</p>

<p>"No," Elsie said, reddening; "do you think
so meanly of me as to suppose I obey my father
only from fear of punishment?"</p>

<p>"No; and I beg your pardon. I know
you're fond of him, too, and that you want to
do right. But I have noticed that he is very
polite and considerate of others, and don't you
think he wishes you to be the same?"</p>

<p>"I know he does."</p>

<p>"Then surely he would tell you to go with
us; because your refusal will spoil all our
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Yes, Elsie; it was all for your sake we
borrowed the canoe," said Don; "and if you
refuse to go it will be a great disappointment.
We wouldn't urge you if it would be disobedience;
but did your father ever say you mustn't
row with us on the river?"</p>

<p>"No, Don; but perhaps that was only because
he never thought of your asking me."</p>

<p>"O Elsie, Elsie, do go!" entreated Annis.
"I won't go without you, and I can't bear to
lose the row."</p>

<p>"Didn't Cousin Horace leave you in mother's
care!" asked Cyril.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, what need of hesitation?
Mother lets Annis go, and of course she would
let you."</p>

<p>Elsie stood for a moment, silently weighing
the question in her mind. Certainly her papa
had great confidence in "Aunt Marcia's" opinion,
for had he not said she might read whatever
Aunt Marcia recommended? and he had
left her in her care; also, he did teach her to
be considerate of the wishes of others; he had
told her only last night not to be selfish in little
things. Surely he would not have her spoil
the afternoon's pleasure of these three cousins.</p>

<p>Ah, but he was never willing to have her
exposed to unnecessary danger! But Cyril
said there was really no danger, and&mdash;she did
so want to go! it looked so pleasant on the
water!</p>

<p>The scales were almost evenly balanced, and
finally she allowed inclination to decide her,
gave Cyril her hand, and was quickly seated
in the canoe with the delighted Annis by her
side.</p>

</div></div>


<p>The boys took up their oars again, pushed
out a little from the shore, and rowed up
stream for a short distance, then turned and
went down for a mile or more, keeping out of
the main current all the time, according to
promise.</p>

<p>Elsie felt a trifle timid at first, and a little
troubled lest she had not done quite right in
yielding to her cousins' persuasions; but gradually
these disquieting thoughts and feelings
passed away, and she gave herself up to thorough
enjoyment of the present pastime.</p>

<p>They chatted, laughed, and sang; dipped
their hands in the clear water; gazed through
it at the pebbly bottom, and the fish darting
hither and thither; landed in several places to
gather bright autumn leaves; then re-entered
the canoe for another row.</p>

<p>The air was delightful, and most of the way
they were pretty well shaded from the sun by
the high bank and its trees and bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys did not soon tire with their work,
for their load was light; going down stream
required but little use of their oars, and even
rowing up was not very laborious. So the
afternoon slipped away before they knew it.</p>

<p>"I believe the sun is getting low," Cyril
said at length, "and we are a good mile from
home. We must turn, Don. What time is it,
Elsie?"</p>

<p>Taking out her pretty watch, "Half-past
five," she said in some dismay, "and the air
begins to feel a little chilly. Don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and it's supper-time. Come, Don,
my lad, we must pull lustily."</p>

<p>"Yes, a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull
both together," responded Don gayly, as he
bent to his oar.</p>

<p>"We ought to have brought shawls along
for you girls," Cyril remarked, with an anxious
glance at his little cousin.</p>

<p>"I'm not cold," said Annis.</p>

<p>"But Elsie is. Here, little coz, let me put
this round you," he said, pulling off his coat;
"nobody will see, and I wouldn't have you
take a chill from this expedition for anything
in the world."</p>

<p>"But you will be cold," Elsie said, shrinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
back, as he would have put it about her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Not a bit; rowing keeps a fellow warm as
toast this time of year," he returned, with a
light laugh: and she made no further resistance.</p>

<p>Nearing the grotto, they saw Aunt Chloe
standing at the water's edge, with a shawl on
her arm, looking out anxiously for her nursling.</p>

<p>"O mammy! has papa come?" Elsie called
to her.</p>

<p>"No, darlin'; 'spect massa'll be 'long dreckly.
But what for my chile go off in de boat widout
a shawl, when de ebenins gits so cool? Ise
'fraid massa be mighty vexed 'bout it. And
s'pose you'd got drownded, honey, what den?"</p>

<p>"Come now, Aunt Chloe, it's all my fault,
and if there's to be any scolding, I'm the one
to take it," Cyril said good-humoredly, as he
helped Elsie ashore.</p>

<p>"O mammy! was it naughty in me to go?
Do you think papa will be displeased with
me?" the little girl asked in an anxious whisper,
while the nurse was busied in carefully
wrapping the shawl about her; Cyril's coat
having been returned with thanks.</p>

<p>"Maybe not. Dere, honey, don't you fret."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where was the harm in her going? But
you won't tell of her, Aunt Chloe?" Annis said,
as they climbed the steps that led up the bank.</p>

<p>"No, chile, s'pect not; ain't no 'casion no
how; massa neber in de house bery long fo'
Miss Elsie tell him all she's been adoin'."</p>

<p>"Shall you tell him, Elsie?" Annis asked,
turning to her cousin as they gained the top
of the flight of steps.</p>

<p>"Yes; I can't feel easy till papa knows all
about it. I'm afraid I oughtn't to have
gone."</p>

<p>There was a tone of distress in Elsie's
voice, and, indeed, she began to be sorely
troubled in prospect of her father's displeasure;
for her mammy's words had caused her
to see her conduct in going on the river in a
new light, and she had now scarce a hope that
it would meet his approval. Besides, they
were certainly late for supper, and he was
particular in regard to promptness at meals.</p>

<p>They hurried into the house, expecting to
find their elders seated about the table. But
there was no one in the dining-room, and
though the table was set, the meal was not
spread. The ladies had returned, but were
waiting for the gentlemen, who had not yet
come in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Elsie was not sorry. She hastened up-stairs
to be made neat for tea, and was down again
in a few minutes.</p>

<p>Still nothing was to be seen or heard of the
huntsmen, and she began to grow uneasy.
Perhaps some accident had happened to her
dear papa; maybe she was to be punished in
that way for what she began to look upon as
an act of disobedience or something very near it.</p>

<p>"Aunt Marcia," she said, drawing near to
Mrs. Keith, "what do you think makes them
stay so long?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear; but nothing serious, I
trust. They probably went farther than they
had intended. But don't be anxious; I do
not see any cause for alarm," was the cheerful,
kindly answer.</p>

<p>Supper had been delayed a full hour already,
and Mrs. Keith decided that it should wait no
longer. "It is not worth while," she said, "for
very likely our gentlemen have supped somewhere
on the road."</p>

<p>Elsie was unusually silent, and seemed to
have lost her appetite. Her eyes turned every
moment toward the door; her ear was strained
to catch every sound from the street. Oh,
what could be keeping her papa?</p>

<p>They left the table, and she stationed herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
at a front window to wait and watch for
his coming.</p>

<p>Mildred drew near, passed an arm about the
child's waist, and with a gentle kiss asked,
"Why are you so troubled and anxious, dear
little girlie? It is nothing strange that our
fathers should be a little late in getting home
to-night."</p>

<p>Then Elsie, laying her head on her cousin's
shoulder, whispered in her sympathizing ear a
tearful story of how the afternoon had been
spent, and her fear that she had done wrong
in going out in the canoe, and that perhaps
she might be punished by something dreadful
happening to her "dear, dear papa."</p>

<p>"I hardly think it was wrong, dear," Mildred
said; "not a very serious fault, at any
rate. And I cannot believe our Heavenly
Father would visit you with such a punishment.
He never treats us according to our
deserts. He is 'a God ready to pardon, gracious
and merciful, slow to anger, and of
great kindness.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; the Bible tells us that,"
Elsie returned, wiping away her tears. "How
good he is to me, and to all his creatures; it
makes me ashamed and sorry for all the sin
in my heart and life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>Mildred presently began talking of the old
days at Viamede and Roselands, trying thus
to help the little girl to forgetfulness of her
anxiety. Elsie grew cheerful and apparently
interested in her cousin's reminiscences of her
babyhood; but still her eyes turned every now
and then to the window, and her ears seemed
attentive to every sound from without.</p>

<p>The clock struck eight, and with a sigh she
drew out her watch and compared the two.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "why don't they come? I
must go to bed in half an hour, and I do so
want to see papa first."</p>

<p>"Do you think he wouldn't let you stay up
to wait for him?" asked Mildred.</p>

<p>"No, cousin, he always insists on my going
to bed at the regular hour, unless he has given
me permission to stay up longer."</p>

<p>The half hour was almost gone&mdash;only five
minutes left&mdash;when at last Elsie's ear caught
the sound of a well-known step and voice.</p>

<p>She ran to the door, "Papa, papa! I'm so
glad, so <em>glad</em> you've come! I was so afraid
something had happened to you."</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew my little girl would be anxious,"
he said, bending down to give her a
tender caress. "Well, there was nothing
wrong, except that we went a little farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
than we intended; and here we are safe and
sound."</p>

<p>"And both tired and hungry, I dare say,"
said Mrs. Keith.</p>

<p>"The first, but not the last," returned her
husband. "We took our supper an hour
ago, at Ward's."</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore sat down and drew Elsie to
his side. "Ah, is it so late?" he said, glancing
at the clock. "Just your bed-time, daughter."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, but&mdash;" and with her arm about
his neck, her lips to his ear, she whispered the
rest&mdash;"I want so much to tell you something.
Mayn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes; go up now and let Aunt Chloe make
you ready for bed; then put on your dressing-gown
and slippers and come to my room. I
shall be there by that time, and we'll have our
little talk. I should hardly like to go to bed
without it myself."</p>

<p>Elsie obeyed, and he presently excusing himself,
on the plea of fatigue, for so early a retirement,
went to his room, where she found
him waiting for her as he had promised.</p>

<p>"Well, my pet, have you anything particular
for papa's ear to-night?" he asked, lifting
her to his knee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, papa. But aren't you too tired to
hold me?"</p>

<p>"No; it rests me to have my darling in my
arms," he answered, caressing her with his
wonted tender fondness.</p>

<p>"Papa, I'm afraid I don't deserve it to-night,"
she murmured, hanging her head,
while a deep blush suffused her cheek.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry indeed, if that is so," he said
gently; "but very glad that my little daughter
never tries to conceal any wrong-doing
of her own from me."</p>

<p>Then he waited for her to speak; he knew
there was no need to question her.</p>

<p>"Papa," she said, so low that he barely
caught the words, "I went out on the river in
a canoe, with Annis, this afternoon. Cyril and
Don rowed it."</p>

<p>"And my little girl went without her father's
permission?" His tone was one of
grieved surprise.</p>

<p>"But you were not here to give it, papa,"
she said, bursting into tears.</p>

<p>"A very good and sufficient reason why my
daughter should have refused to go."</p>

<p>"But, papa, I did not know you would object,
and I thought you would not want me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
to spoil the pleasure of my cousins; and they
said I would if I refused to go."</p>

<p>"I think you certainly knew me well
enough to be quite sure, if you had taken
time to consider the question fully, that I
would be far from willing to let you run
into danger for the pleasure of others."</p>

<p>"But, papa, Aunt Marcia let's Annis go:
and Cyril said there was no danger."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Cyril is only a boy; not capable
of judging. The current of the river is
very swift and strong. I should not have
trusted you upon it in a canoe with those boys
for any consideration, and am truly thankful
that you escaped without accident. But I am
not pleased with you."</p>

<p>"Papa, I am very sorry. Please don't be
angry with me," she sobbed, hiding her face
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, then lifting
her face, wiped away her tears with his handkerchief,
and kissing her lips, said, "I suppose
the temptation was strong, and as it was
not an act of positive disobedience to orders, I
forgive you. But, my little daughter, you
must never do anything of the kind again."</p>

<p>"No, dear papa, I will not," she said, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
a sigh of relief. "You are very kind not to
punish me."</p>

<p>"Not kinder to you than to myself; it
hurts me, I think, quite as much as it does
you when I have to punish you," he said,
with another loving caress. "Now, darling,
bid me good-night and go to your bed."</p>

<p>Annis was in Mildred's room waiting to say
good-night to her cousin, rather uneasy, too,
lest she had got her into trouble, by coaxing
her into the canoe.</p>

<p>"O Elsie!" she said, as the latter came in,
"was your papa displeased? did he punish
you? You look as if you had been crying."</p>

<p>"He said he was not pleased with me," Elsie
answered, brushing away a tear; "that was
punishment enough, I'm sure; but he forgave
me the next minute and kissed me good-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad that was all!" Annis exclaimed,
giving Elsie a hug. "I began to be
almost afraid he had whipped you."</p>

<p>"No, indeed! he never did that, and I
don't believe he ever will," Elsie said, a quick,
vivid blush dyeing her fair face and neck.</p>

<p>The next day the little girls were taking a
walk on the river bank, Aunt Chloe plodding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
along a little in the rear, that she might watch
over her nursling.</p>

<p>A boy coming from the opposite direction
startled them by a loud "Hello, Tim! where
are you going?"</p>

<p>Two boys were just passing them, and the
younger, who looked to be about ten years
old, made answer in a surly tone, and in
words so profane that the little girls shuddered
with horror.</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't want to go 'long with
you; not to that place," remarked the first
jeeringly; "but what's the use o' bein' so all-fired
cross&mdash;swearin' at a feller just for askin'
a civil question?"</p>

<p>"Come, Bill, just you let him alone," said
Tim's companion; "he's worked up and
mad, 'cause his mother told him not to go to
the river, and that's where we're going this
minute."</p>

<p>"Well, then, George, if he gits drowned, I
guess he'll go where he said he was a-goin',"
remarked Bill, passing on.</p>

<p>The little girls stood still, watching the
other two as they hurried on down the bank,
entered a canoe that lay on the water, made
fast by a rope to a tree, loosed it, and pushed
out into the stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>They were not careful as Cyril had been to
keep near the shore, and presently the current
was carrying them down stream very
rapidly.</p>

<p>A few hundred yards below the spot where
they had embarked, a wooden bridge had formerly
spanned the river; it had been torn
down shortly before this, but the posts were
left standing in the water. Against one of
these the canoe struck and instantly overset,
throwing the boys into the water where it was
deepest and most dangerous.</p>

<p>The little girls and their attendant saw the
mishap, and ran screaming toward some men
who were at work at no great distance. The
instant the men comprehended what had occurred,
they made all haste to the scene of the
disaster, and used every effort to rescue the
lads.</p>

<p>They succeeded in bringing George out
alive, but Tim had sunk to rise no more.
They could not even find the body.</p>

<p>When this announcement was made, the
two little girls, who had stood looking on in
intense excitement and full of distress for the
imperilled boys, burst into bitter weeping.</p>

<p>They hurried home, crying as they went, to
tell the sad story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Keith was in the sitting-room, busied
with some sewing, as usual, Mr. Dinsmore
with her, when the children came rushing in,
crying as if their hearts would break.</p>

<p>"Why, my child, what is the matter?" Mr.
Dinsmore asked, in extreme surprise and
alarm, as Elsie threw herself into his arms and
clung to him, sobbing convulsively.</p>

<p>"O mother, mother! we've just seen a boy
drowned!" cried Annis, burying her face in
her mother's lap. "It was Tim Jones, and
his mother had told him not to go to the
river. And we heard him say such wicked
words as he was going."</p>

<p>"And O papa! he's dead," sobbed Elsie,
"and I can't even pray for him! O papa! he
has lost his soul!"</p>

<p>"We do not know that certainly, dear
daughter," he said, trying to comfort her; "we
may have a little hope, for possibly he may
have cried to Jesus for pardon and salvation,
even after he was in the water."</p>

<p>"And Jesus is so kind, so ready to forgive
and save us," she said, growing calmer. "But,
O papa! it's such a <em>little</em> hope we can have
that he did find the way, and get a new heart
in that one minute!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is too sadly true," he sighed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
"Yet the thought uppermost in my mind just
now is, What if this had happened to my
child yesterday! O! my darling, how could
I have borne such a loss? My heart aches
for the parents of that boy."</p>

<p>"Dear papa, God was very good to us,"
she whispered, laying her cheek to his, as he
held her close to his heart. "Oh, I am glad he
did not let me fall into the river and drown,
though I was so naughty as to go without
your leave."</p>

<p>"But I had not forbidden you," he said
tenderly; "and I know that my little girl
loves Jesus, and tries to serve him; so I
should have been spared the terrible pain of
fearing that you were lost to me forever.
Yet I cannot be thankful enough that I have
you still, my precious, precious child!"</p>

<p>His tones were so low that Mrs. Keith
could hardly have caught the words, even had
she not been occupied, as she was, in soothing
and comforting Annis.</p>

<p>Because of the near approach of his appointed
wedding-day Mr. Dinsmore could not linger
long in Pleasant Plains. All felt the parting
keenly, for even in the few days they had
spent together a strong attachment had sprung
up between Elsie and her cousins, while the
renewal of former congenial intercourse had
strengthened the tie of affection that had long
existed between Mrs. Keith and her Cousin
Horace.</p>

<p>Fan and Annis wept so bitterly as the stage
whirled away out of sight, that their mother
and Mildred found it necessary to deny themselves
the indulgence of their own grief in
order to comfort them.</p>

<p>At the same time Mr. Dinsmore was wiping
the tears from Elsie's eyes, and soothing her
with tender caresses and the hope that she and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Mildred and Annis would meet again before a
great while.</p>

<p>"Who knows," he said in cheery tones,
"but we may be able to persuade their father
and mother to let them spend the winter at
the Oaks next year!"</p>

<p>"O papa, how nice that would be!" exclaimed
the child, smiling through her tears;
"will you ask them?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if you will stop crying now. Perhaps
if you keep on I may be tempted to join
you," he added jestingly, "and how ashamed
we would both feel."</p>

<p>That made Elsie laugh. Then he interested
her in plans for purchasing gifts for the cousins
they had just left, and for her "new mamma,"
when they should reach New York, and
soon she was quite her usual sunny self.</p>

<p>Fortunately up to this time their little party
had been the only occupants of the stage.</p>

<p>We have not space to speak further of their
journey, which brought them finally to Philadelphia,
Miss Rose Allison's home, and where
the wedding was to take place.</p>

<p>On arriving in that city Mr. Dinsmore sent
Elsie and her nurse to Mr. Allison's, while he,
with his servant John, went to a hotel. He
was to be married the next morning, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
already late in the afternoon, so the separation
would not be for long.</p>

<p>While taking his supper at the hotel table
Mr. Dinsmore became the unconscious object
of close scrutiny by a gentleman seated nearly
opposite; a rather fine-looking man, tall, well-proportioned,
with good features, an open, intelligent
countenance, benevolent expression,
clear blue eyes, light brown hair and beard.</p>

<p>"I can hardly be mistaken; it is no common
face; but I will make certain," the stranger
said to himself, as he rose and left the room at
the conclusion of his meal.</p>

<p>He went to the hotel register and found
Mr. Dinsmore's name among those entered
that day. He saw it with a thrill of pleasure;
and yet&mdash;"well, he could not know till he had
tried to renew the acquaintance, whether to
do so would be agreeable to the friend of his
boyhood."</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore retired to his own apartment
on leaving the table, and had scarcely done so
when a servant handed in a card.</p>

<p>"Charles Landreth, M.D.," was the inscription
it bore. Mr. Dinsmore read it at a glance.
His first emotion was surprise, the next a mixture
of feelings.</p>

<p>"Show the gentleman up here; tell him I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
shall be happy to see him," he said to the
waiter. Then, as the man closed the door and
departed, he turned and paced the floor with
slow, meditative step.</p>

<p>"It may be a good Providence that brings
us together so unexpectedly just at this time,"
he said to himself. "I should never have expected
dishonorable conduct from my old
chum Charlie Landreth, and I'll give him the
benefit of the doubt as long as I can. Ah,
God grant I may be able to set this matter
right for poor Mildred!"</p>

<p>Steps approached, the door opened, and the
two stood face to face.</p>

<p>"Horace! you have not forgotten me?"
The voice, the grasp of the hand, the beaming
countenance, all spoke such sincere pleasure,
such warmth of friendship, that Mr. Dinsmore's
doubts vanished; that was not the face
of a false, cold-hearted villain. He returned
the greeting as cordially as it was given.</p>

<p>"Forgotten you, Charlie? No, indeed! and
I'm particularly glad that you have made yourself
known to-night; for to-morrow I shall be
on my way south again."</p>

<p>"Ah, going back to the old neighborhood
where we were boys together," and Charlie
heaved a sigh to the memory of the days of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
auld lang syne, as he accepted a mute invitation
to be seated. "Have you been long absent?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"For several months. I am lately returned
from Indiana, where I have been visiting my
cousins the Keiths."</p>

<p>As he pronounced the name Mr. Dinsmore
looked keenly at his companion.</p>

<p>Landreth flushed hotly and his look was both
eager and pained as he responded, with a little
hesitation in his speech. "Ah! and were they&mdash;all
well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, and prospering. One of
the girls&mdash;there are five in all&mdash;is married."</p>

<p>"Mildred?" asked his listener in a hoarse
whisper, and with half-averted face.</p>

<p>"No; she is still single, and it struck me as
strange, for she is a most lovely and attractive
girl in both person and character."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A perfect woman, nobly planned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To warn, to comfort, and command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet a spirit still and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With something of an angel light."</span>
</div></div>

<p>"I think I never saw one to whom Wordsworth's
description was more truly applicable."</p>

<p>Landreth turned and grasped Mr. Dinsmore's
hand, his face all aglow with hope and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
joy. "You have lifted me from the depths of
despair!" he said in tremulous tones.</p>

<p>"You have cared for her?"</p>

<p>"Loved her as never man loved woman before!"</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore smiled at that, thinking of
Rose, and his early love, the mother of his
child, but did not care to combat the assertion.
"She is worthy of it," was all he said.</p>

<p>"I heard she was married, and it nearly
killed me," Landreth went on. "But I could
not blame her, for she had steadily refused to
pledge herself to me."</p>

<p>"But where have you been all these years,
and how is it that I find you here now, Charlie?
I should be glad to hear your story."</p>

<p>"I went first to the mines of South America,"
Landreth said, "saw very hard times for
the first two years, then met with a wonderful
turn of fortune&mdash;coming quite unexpectedly
upon a very large nugget of gold. I didn't
stay long after that. I had written to Mildred
a good many times, but never received a line
from her, and almost the first news I heard on
returning to my native land was that of her
marriage. As I have said, it nearly killed me;
but, Dinsmore, my bitter sorrow and disappointment
did for me what perhaps nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
else could. I sought and found Him, of whom
Moses in the law and the prophets did write,
Jesus of Nazareth, the sinner's Saviour and
Friend."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that, Charlie!" Mr. Dinsmore
returned with emotion; and again their
hands met in a warm brotherly clasp.</p>

<p>"Having found him," continued Landreth,
"of course his service became my first object in
life. I looked about for a sphere of usefulness,
and decided upon the medical profession, because
I had discovered that I had a liking for
it, the necessities of the men in my employ
having led me to dip into it a little. So I came
here to pursue my studies, received my diploma
a year ago, have been practicing in the hospitals
since, and am now looking about for the
best place in which to begin my career as a
private physician and surgeon."</p>

<p>"Plenty of room in the West," observed
Mr. Dinsmore sententiously and with a sparkle
of fun in his eye.</p>

<p>Landreth sprang up. "And my darling is
there, and you have given me hope that I may
yet win her! Dinsmore, I shall make the necessary
arrangements immediately, and set off
for Pleasant Plains at the earliest possible moment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right, Charlie; and you have my best
wishes for your success both with her and in
your chosen profession. But I hope you will
not leave Philadelphia before to-morrow noon.
I want you at my wedding. Mildred and the
rest will be glad to hear an account of it from
an eye-witness."</p>

<p>"Your wedding?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is to take place at nine to-morrow
morning. And I want the pleasure of introducing
my intended cousin to my bride; to
say nothing of showing you one whose charms
of person and character are not eclipsed by
even those of sweet and lovely Mildred
Keith."</p>

<p>"She must be worth seeing, if that be the
case," Landreth answered with a smile. "And
I am keeping you from her now, I daresay;
for which she certainly will not thank me."</p>

<p>"She is too kind-hearted not to be more
than content for Mildred's and your sake."</p>

<p>"Mildred's do you say?" and Landreth's
face was one glow of delight.</p>

<p>"Yes, Charlie, for Mildred's; since you have
so frankly told me how it is with you, I shall
not conceal from you that it is for your sake
the sweet girl has remained single in spite of
several good offers. I learned it from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
Cousin Marcia, her mother. And while I
think of it," he added laughingly, "let me assure
you that Marcia will make&mdash;does make&mdash;a
model mother-in-law."</p>

<p>"I should be glad indeed to try her in that
capacity," returned Landreth lightly. "I
think it will hardly be possible for me to leave
before to-morrow noon; so accept your invitation
with thanks, Dinsmore. I have a curiosity
to see your bride, and a very strong desire
to renew my acquaintance with your little
daughter, whom I used to see quite frequently
in the first two years of her stay at Roselands.
I have always thought her the sweetest little
creature I ever beheld. She is with you of
course?"</p>

<p>"In the city? Yes; you will see her to-morrow,"
Mr. Dinsmore answered, looking
highly gratified by the encomium upon his darling
child.</p>

<p>After a little more chat, principally of mutual
friends and the changes that had taken
place in their old neighborhood since Landreth
left it, they separated with another cordial
hand-shaking, both extremely glad of the casual
meeting, and expecting to meet again on
the morrow.</p>

<span class="i26">"Within her heart was his image,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloth'd in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence."<br /></span>
<span class="i26"><span class="smcap">Longfellow.</span></span>
</div></div>


<p>It was evening. Mildred was alone in the
parlor, all the rest of the family having gone
to a concert. They had urged her to go too,
but she had declined, saying she greatly preferred
a quiet evening at home. Truth to tell
she was oppressed with sadness, and wanted to
be alone that she might indulge it for a little
without restraint.</p>

<p>All day she had maintained a cheerfulness
in the presence of others which she did not
feel, for there had been scarce a moment when
her lost love was absent from her thoughts.
Why was it that her heart went out toward
him to-night with such yearning tenderness&mdash;such
unutterable longing to look into his eyes,
to hear the sound of his voice, to feel the
touch of his hand?</p>

<p>She tried in vain to read; the image of the
lost one constantly obtruded itself between
her mental vision and the printed page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>She rose and paced the floor, not weeping,
but pressing her hand to her heart with heavy
sighing.</p>

<p>The curtains were not closely drawn, or the
shutters closed; a lamp burned brightly on the
centre-table, and the room was full of warmth
and cheer.</p>

<p>She did not hear the opening or shutting of
the gate, or a quick, manly step that came up
the gravel walk and into the porch; did not
see the stranger pause before the bright window
and gaze in, half-unconsciously, as if spell-bound
by the sight of her graceful figure and
fair though sad face. She turned to the open
piano, struck a few chords, then seated herself
and sang in clear, sweet tones, but with touching
pathos:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When true hearts lie withered<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fond ones are flown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! who would inhabit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This bleak world alone?"</span>
</div></div>

<p>Then with a sudden change of feeling, she
touched the chords anew and burst into a song
of praise, her voice swelling out full and high
like the glad song of a bird:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, the height of Jesus' love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Higher than the heavens above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deeper than the depths of sea,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Lasting as eternity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love that found me&mdash;wondrous thought!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found me when I sought him not."</span>
</div></div>

<p>"A gentleman to see you, Miss Mildred,"
said the voice of Celestia Ann at the parlor
door.</p>

<p>Mildred rose and turned to greet him, in
some surprise, for she had not heard the ringing
of the door-bell or the sound of the girl's footsteps
as she passed through the hall to answer
it.</p>

<p>The latter retreated as she ushered the
stranger in, but lingered a moment, peering
curiously through the crack behind the door.
She saw him step forward with outstretched
hand, Mildred moving toward him with an
earnest, inquiring look up into his face; then
an ashy paleness suddenly overspread hers,
she staggered and would have fallen, but he
caught her in his arms, saying in low, tremulous
tones as he held her close to his heart,
"Mildred, darling, it is I! Oh, tell me, dear
one, that you have not forgotten me!"</p>

<p>"I know'd it! I know'd there was somebody
somewheres she cared fer! and I'm
mighty glad he's come at last, fer her sake,"
chuckled Celestia Ann, nodding and smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
to herself as she retreated to her kitchen;
"though I'll be dreadful sorry, too, if he carries
her oft to some fer-away place."</p>

<p>To those two in the parlor the next hour
was probably the most blissful they had ever
known. Dr. Landreth's story was briefly told&mdash;to
be dwelt upon more in detail in future
talks, and then&mdash;but we will not intrude upon
their privacy.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Keith, returning from the
concert, found their daughter seated by the
side of one who was an entire stranger to
them; yet there was small need of introduction,
for by the look of restful happiness in
her face they knew instantly who he was, and
that all was right between them. From the
first all were favorably impressed by Landreth's
open, intelligent countenance, polished manners,
manly yet modest mien; and a few days
of intimate association made him almost as
great a favorite in the family as Wallace
Ormsby; while the latter was not far behind
the others in his liking for the new-comer.</p>

<p>Mildred was very happy, and all her dear
ones rejoiced with her; especially when it became
known among them that it was not Dr.
Landreth's intention or wish to carry her
away from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he said; "I know too well how sad a
thing it is to be fatherless, motherless, and
without any other near relative, to desire to
separate the dear girl from hers. What I
want is the privilege of sharing them with
her."</p>

<p>"Which we will all be glad to have you
do," returned Mrs. Keith, to whom the remark
was addressed, tears of sympathy for his
past forlorn condition glistening in her eyes;
"we will rejoice to make you one of us, not
for Mildred's sake alone, but for your own
also."</p>

<p>"Accept my heartiest thanks, my dear
madam," the young man said with emotion;
"you may perhaps have some idea what it
will be to me to have a mother, when I tell
you that mine died before my earliest recollection."</p>

<p>Not even to his betrothed had Charlie
disclosed the fact that he was again a man
of wealth; he merely assured Mr. Keith that
he felt himself able to support a wife comfortably,
having a good profession, and means
enough to live upon until he should become
well established in it.</p>

<p>Pleasant Plains was now growing so rapidly,
the surrounding country filling up so fast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
that hardly a better location for a young
physician could be desired, and he decided
to settle in the town at once.</p>

<p>And now what was to hinder an immediate
marriage? This was the question he
urged upon Mildred and her parents, but
without obtaining a prompt and decided answer.
The parents had given full consent to
the match, yet seemed very loath to resign
their daughter.</p>

<p>Cyril sided with Landreth; because, as he
said, he wanted to be present at the wedding,
and as he was to leave for college in a few
days, and felt certain they would not wait
till he came back, his only chance was to
have it take place before he went; so he
coaxed and persuaded, overruled all objections,
and finally gained his point.</p>

<p>"It won't be parting with her," he said
to his father and mother; "they'll board at
home at least till spring. I asked the doctor,
and he's delighted with the idea." To Mildred
herself: "What's the use waiting to
make up a lot of finery? You can do that afterwards.
You have two new dresses just
made up for fall any way, and there's mother's
wedding-dress that Zillah was married in fits
you just as well, and makes you look lovely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
We can't get up as big a wedding as Zil's
all in a hurry to be sure, but I don't believe
you care for that."</p>

<p>"No," she said; "I should much prefer having
only relatives and a few very near friends."</p>

<p>"It would save expense to father and a
great deal of fuss and trouble to mother,"
was the next and most effectual consideration
he urged. "Then too," he added a little
mischievously, "Mr. Lord's away just now,
and that will give you a chance to have the
knot tied by your future brother-in-law&mdash;same
as Zillah had."</p>

<p>This last was a stronger inducement than
he knew or suspected; she had an earnest desire
to have the ceremony performed by her
old friend Frank Osborne, and was a little apprehensive
of some blunder on the part of absent-minded
Mr. Lord, should he officiate.</p>

<p>"Frank's to preach for us next Sunday,"
Cyril went on. "He'll stay over Monday if we
ask him, and if you'll let me arrange matters
I'll appoint Monday evening for the wedding."</p>

<p>"How very kind in you," she returned
laughing.</p>

<p>"Come now, Milly, say yes," he continued,
not deigning to notice the interruption. "I'm
to leave on Wednesday you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>"Monday, Cyril! Why that's wash-day,
and Celestia Ann won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll settle that," he interrupted, making a
hasty exit from the room.</p>

<p>After a brief absence he returned in great
glee. "I thought I could manage it," he
said, "and I have. She's delighted with the
idea of a wedding that shall take everybody
in town by surprise. She won't give up the
washing, but says she'll be up early enough to
have it out of the way by nine o'clock; and
then she'll 'turn in and bake cake.' She'll
bake some to-morrow, too, so there 'won't be
no trouble 'bout the 'freshments, not a mite.'
Now, Milly, haven't I taken the last stone out
of the way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you dear old fellow," she said, with
a look of sisterly love and pride into his bright,
eager young face; "and it shall be as you
wish. Mother and I have been talking over
your plan, and think it practicable. Also that
it would be too bad to disappoint you, to say
nothing of some one else even more nearly
concerned," she added, with a charming blush
and smile.</p>

<p>"That's a good girl! I knew you would!
I'll run and tell the doctor." And he was off
before Mildred could stop him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course Dr. Landreth was delighted. No
one else raised any objection, and hasty preparations
were at once set on foot.</p>

<p>Mildred thought she ought to be the busiest
of them all, but mother and sisters would not
hear of it. "You have been working for
everybody else for years past," they said;
"now it is your turn to rest and have a good
time. So just devote yourself to the entertainment
of the doctor, or to being entertained
by him." Finding them determined to dispense
with her assistance, Mildred submitted
with a good grace; the more so as Charlie
managed to engross her time and attention
almost constantly.</p>

<p>He had arrived on Monday, and it was on
Friday that her consent to Cyril's plan was
given.</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore's visit had created quite a
sensation in the town. It was reported that
he had come for Mildred; but the advent of
this stranger who, though lodging at the principal
hotel, spent his days at Mr. Keith's,
modified the rumors, and people were on the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">qui vive</i> to learn which, if either, was the
favored suitor.</p>

<p>The wedding passed off very nicely, just
at the time and in the way that Cyril had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
planned, and the next morning the gossips of
the town were electrified by the news.</p>

<p>The bride had a great surprise that day in
her turn. It came in the shape of a mysterious
box directed to her, which on opening
was found to contain a beautiful bridal bonnet,
three dress-patterns of rich silk&mdash;a delicate
rose color, a silver gray, and a rich dark brown&mdash;gloves,
laces, ribbons, and flowers.</p>

<p>The whole family had gathered round to
watch the opening and unpacking of the box,
and each article was examined in turn with
many exclamations of admiration and delight.
At the very bottom they came upon a note.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Milly</span>:</p>

<p>"A little bird has whispered to me that you
are soon to be a bride, and Elsie and I are
very glad of the excuse to send a few trifling
gifts, which we hope you will do us the kindness
to accept as tokens of the sincere affection
we both feel for you.</p>

<p class="quotsig">"<span class="smcap">Cousin Horace.</span>"</p></div>

<p>There had been no time for parents and
friends to prepare bridal gifts, and excepting
a beautiful set of pearls Dr. Landreth had purchased
for her before leaving Philadelphia,
these were the first Mildred had received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>"How very kind and thoughtful!" she
said, her eyes glistening with mingled emotions;
"but how did they manage it? What
time was there for shopping after Cousin Horace
saw you, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"I should say by no means enough for the
purchase of all these," Dr. Landreth answered,
evidently as much puzzled as herself.</p>

<p>A letter from Adelaide Dinsmore, received
by the next mail, explained it. She had been
present at Horace's wedding, acting as bridesmaid,
had remained behind when he left with
wife and daughter for their home in the
South, and had executed these commissions
for him and Elsie, adding some gifts from herself
and parents. She wrote in a cordial,
affectionate way, and begged for a speedy
reply telling all about the marriage. "Because
she could get nothing out of Horace
except that there was to be one."</p>

<p>"Mildred, you must come out in bridal
attire next Sunday," Zillah said with energy.
"You're to wear the new bonnet and that
grey silk. We'll have it made in time."</p>

<p>It was made in time, and very lovely Mildred
looked in it. She was the cynosure of
all eyes; yet another bride shared the attention
of the curious.</p>

<p>Years ago Gotobed Lightcap had gone to a
distant city to pursue his studies. To-day, a
licensed preacher of the Gospel, he filled Mr.
Lord's pulpit, and gave the congregation an
earnest, able, well-written discourse.</p>

<p>After the service he brought his wife&mdash;a
pretty, ladylike little body&mdash;and with a proud
and happy look introduced her to Mildred.</p>

<p>The two ladies shook hands cordially, Mildred
furtively examining the other with curiosity,
Gotobed regarding Dr. Landreth in
like manner. Then Mildred introduced them,
and they exchanged congratulations and good
wishes.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Lightcap was in many ways
a vast improvement upon the young blacksmith
of Mildred's early acquaintance, especially
as regarded education, intelligence, and
refinement of speech and manner.</p>

<p>Dr. Landreth was greatly interested in him
and his story as told by Mildred on the homeward
walk. And she was very happy in the
assurance that she had not, even innocently,
wrecked his happiness; yet more in the love
that now made life's pathway look so bright
before her.</p>
